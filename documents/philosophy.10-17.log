01:12 < Inst> this is going to upset me
01:13 < Inst> but existence cannot precede essence

01:13 -!- Guest42586 [~Marcos@unaffiliated/marcos] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
01:13 < Inst> logic: for something to exist in and of itself
01:13 < Inst> it can exist before being defined, but for us to conceive of a concept we have to have an essence with which we define it
01:14 < Inst> it may be a loose definition (man is mutable)
01:14 < Inst> but existence implies essence
01:31 < pug> from a logical perspective it's popular to assume essence and existence are distinct and coextensive.
01:32 -!- vaejm [~vaejm@gateway/tor-sasl/vaejm] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
01:32 < pug> at least with respect to ontological precedence
01:33 < pug> From within a conceptual framework it makes sense to assume as much.
01:37 < pug> existence precedes essence just in case a concept implies an object or a thing *does* inamsuch as it *is* maybe. It's hard to argue for a sensible priority out of a systematic context too.
01:37 -!- mohlaris [~tpixvas@public-118-110.nat.utoronto.ca] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
01:41 < pug> it's just as reasonable to assume the mistake is made at distinguishing between essence and existence by instead assuming they're actually indistinct and instead each addresses a different perspective of the same state of affairs.

01:50 -!- Marcos [~Marcos@unaffiliated/marcos] has quit [Quit: ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz]
01:57 < aloo_shu> some of what went before is in the nature of defining, always needing something to define with, hence attempts to define may lead to unexpected results when applied to the very roots of logical edifices.
01:58 < aloo_shu> either precedence may be apparant only, fruit of the endeavour to define.
02:04 < aloo_shu> an obvious way out is to 'define as' instead of 'define by/with', only that you couldn't claim to have found out anything then. exitence, essence or whatever you choose will have their place by wilful definition.
02:04 < aloo_shu> *existence
02:04 < PerryM> aloo_shu: nothing exists
02:05 < aloo_shu> define nothing
02:05 < chu> Here is a hand.
02:05  * aloo_shu claps frenetically
02:06 < aloo_shu> (wrong association? with one hand, of course)
02:08 < PerryM> aloo_shu: "nothing" is a state where a statement of "this exists" is false.
02:09 < aloo_shu> what's a state?

02:09 < chu> Solid British philosophers.
02:10 < aloo_shu> and I had assumed rinzai weirdos - lemme look
02:12 < PerryM> aloo_shu:  a state is a claim that is either true or false.
02:12 < aloo_shu> so nothing exists, but boolean logic does?
02:13 < aloo_shu> chu probably a handy link on this chan :)
02:13 < PerryM> All  pre-21st philosophers are wrong by definition... they were unaware of Scientific discoveries. All, except the pre-Socratics, of course, who figured out how most of the world works independently of our current scientific knowledge, that was crippled by religion for more than 2,000 years

02:27 < binarycat> Moral dilemma: RichPublicFigureScientistMan has publicly announced that he will never stop researching a cure for cancer, even though Big Pharma are trying to stop him. One day, they go so far as to kidnap his little daughter, send video proof to him and tell him that unless he stops all his research, they will torture the little girl to death and then burn the body. He still refuses to back down, and so they torture and kill her, sending video
02:27 < binarycat> proof of this to him, which he watches in terror. Did he do the right thing? Is he a good man for standing by his word, even though this means an innocent girl was tortured and murdered as a result?
02:30 -!- aloo_shu is now known as MullahNasruddin
02:30 < PerryM> I don't understand how this questions end up on philosophy chats. That's not a philosophy question. It's a social morality or individual morality or character question. Human behavior is the study of Psychology and Sociology. Not Philosophy.
02:30 < PerryM> *these questions

02:32 < iz> binarycat: that's just a complicated version of the train track dilemma problem

02:34 < iz> and the scientist can either pull the lever to divert the train into the crowd, saving the little girl.. or he can do nothing and allow the little girl to be run over by the train, saving the crowd..
02:34 < aggi> doing good and talking about it
02:34 < iz> it's pretty much the same moral dilemma
02:35 < aggi> why would you place a little girl or a crowd of 100 onto tracks?
02:35 < aggi> to decide later on what would be more appealing to talk about
02:35 < iz> well, it's just as contrived as terrorists that kidnap his daughter and insist he stop cancer research

03:00 < stefycute> Morning
03:02 < aloo_shu> good morning, how far east are you?
03:04 < astroo-> hello
03:04 < stefycute> Hi
03:05 < EasyAsPie> hi
03:05 < stefycute> Whats up?
03:06 < EasyAsPie> nothing up
03:07 < EasyAsPie> all down
03:07 < EasyAsPie> you?
03:07 < stefycute> well i am
03:07 < stefycute> High as the stars ;)
03:07 < EasyAsPie> oh
03:07 < EasyAsPie> how
03:08 < stefycute> Nothing ^^
03:08 < EasyAsPie> :o
03:08 < chu> binarycat: How is it any different?
03:09 < chu> Personally, neither of the scenarios are very interesting to me, so I have no answer. But from what I can see, they are the exact same.
03:11 < dioz> seems pretty simple to me
03:11 < dioz> you can always make new kids
03:11 < dioz> it's pretty easy... and fun
03:11 < dioz> ;]
03:11 < dioz> my great great grandparents settled in northern GMT-6
03:12 < stefycute> oo what are u talking bout
03:12 < dioz> they had like 12 or 13 kids i think
03:12 < EasyAsPie> who
03:12 < dioz> my grandma tells stories of throwing a child to the wolves to protect the horses
03:12 < dioz> this was before she died when she started going crazy though so who knows if it's true or not
03:14 < dioz> her husband told me a story about their horse trailer catching on fire and not being able to separate the horses and having to do a large portion of the grain farming without horses
03:14 < dioz> i think we've become so removed from ideas of hardship that the thought of death is just terrible to us
03:15 < aloo_shu> there is a point
03:15 < dioz> we've, westerners, had it so easy for so long we forget what it's like to experience terrible shit...
03:15 < dioz> or that terrible shit can happen
03:16 < aloo_shu> or take the stoics on death
03:17 < stefycute> Okay i dont get what ur talking bout
03:17 < aloo_shu> "not death is terrible. the thought that death was terrible: that is terrible"
03:17 < stefycute> Going to back on discussing with hegel
03:18 < dioz> aloo_shu: like the vikings
03:18 < dioz> or the spartans
03:18 < stefycute> Never went bundy jumping do u?
03:18 < aloo_shu> bungee? no
03:18 < stefycute> Yeah forgot the spelling
03:18 < stefycute> The rush
03:19 < stefycute> Okay gtg
03:19 < stefycute> Ciaaaoooooooooo
03:19 < aloo_shu> ciao ragazzo/a
03:19 < dioz> i also don't think i tend to put as much value in people as others do
03:20 < dioz> maybe i'm a sociopath

03:20 < astroo-> bye people
03:21 < aloo_shu> I think about that more often now that I do irc intensives
03:21 < aloo_shu> bye astroo-
03:21 < astroo-> bye
03:22 < EasyAsPie> how r u?
03:22 < aloo_shu> irc - language based - very logos/ratio oriented
03:22 < dioz> i've irc'd since i was young.  i think it affects the way i interact with people too
03:23 < aloo_shu> a place where the development of our most recent accquisition - the neocortex - stands out more
03:23 < dioz> i view people, mainly, as someone i can "learn" from.  in the broadest sense
03:23 < aloo_shu> but still, that's representative of society at large
03:24 < dioz> if i have nothing, really, to learn from someone i find my interest in that person dwindles
03:24 < dioz> i'm not likely to attempt to maintain any kind of relationship with them
03:24 < dioz> or, once i feel as though i've "milked them dry" of potential information/knowledge i just kind of move on
03:25 < aloo_shu> there remains to *make it so* that you can learn
03:25 < dioz> elaborate
03:25 < dioz> idk what you mean
03:25 < aloo_shu> from anybody
03:25 < dioz> make it so?
03:26 < aloo_shu> but this is what I was getting at, we're so obsessed with reason, we neglect our animal nature, namely our aspect of being mammals
03:26 < chu> EasyAsPie: Still don't contribute to the channel, do you...
03:26 < aloo_shu> mammals have a limbic system on top of the brain stem
03:26 < dioz> aloo_shu: what is our aspect of being mammals would you say?
03:27 < aloo_shu> limbic system enables such features as recognizing offspring, bonding - lizards may eat their kids without noticing
03:28 < aloo_shu> so bonding, empathy, are functions of the limbic system, the brain part we more or less share with mammals and birds
03:28 < dioz> i don't bond and i don't have empathy
03:28 < dioz> HAH
03:28 < dioz> so what you're saying seems accurate
03:28 < dioz> but i'm only one person
03:29 < dioz> the extent of my bonding is to satisfy my need for a source of entertainment for whatever time period i see fit
03:29 < dioz> in which case i just pry into peoples lives for my own entertainment
03:29 < dioz> it's amazing the things people will tell you about themselves
03:31 < aloo_shu> it seems to be so that the neocortex can have an override on the limbic system, and evolution has not yet clearly shown what that is meant for, yet humanity experiments with it wildly, and in the act, is loosing some useful behaviour that was taken for granted
03:33 < aloo_shu> you can take all glorifications of will as a starting point for investing the rationales that go with the process
03:34 < dioz> hmmm
03:35 < aloo_shu> so to come back, dioz, harnessing some of this empathy, that animal attraction to the own specie, can serve as a bridge to loearn something from everyone

03:38 < dioz> i don't know if i agree with that
03:38 < aloo_shu> it is in the nature of the approach that it cannot totally be rendered rationally, but the accompanying thoughts, and the neocortex always accompanies, would be along the lines of: "he/she is human. he/she is like me. I should be able to put myself into that person's shoes." that opens learning opportunities other than knowledge, more oriented towards say, life skills, how do folks deal with it all
03:38 < dioz> i think there are other ways you can gain the knowledge from the individuals other than being empathetic
03:39 < aloo_shu> mere knowledge, yes
03:39 -!- seasky is now known as ilken
03:39 < dioz> you're suggesting something like... learning how to cope?with a difficult situation?
03:39 < aloo_shu> and you might even be able to abstract knowledge not known to themselves, from their behaviour
03:40 < aloo_shu> dioz as difficult as you make it. life is change, that alone is enough
03:40 < dioz> i think i'd need an example
03:40 < dioz> any example
03:40 < dioz> even if but a weak example

03:42 < dioz> i follow what you're saying
03:42 < dioz> i just can't think of, for what
03:42 -!- KindTwo is now known as KindOne
03:42 < aloo_shu> I'll link you to my mini-library and recommend the continuum concept, jane liedloff
03:42 < aloo_shu> hang on
03:43 < dioz> i'll liken it to what i think you're saying in comparison to what jordan peterson said...
03:43 < dioz> when we watch a child play with a doll the child isn't copying the mother
03:44 < dioz> the child is enacting the experience of being a mother through their experiences with their mother
03:44 < dioz> if that makes sense
03:44 < aloo_shu> you'll probably have to give the decade to decide, I'm afraid
03:44 < aloo_shu> here comes
03:44 < aloo_shu> https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1mxTnR2vDUsVjlJTENVazZlUnM
03:46 < dioz> alright
03:47 < aloo_shu> dioz, not a full example, but I could think of a few cases where people have impressed me with their courage, and I could not just rationally reduce their behaviour to acting to a protocol I could adapt
03:47 < Fuantum> see ya all later, going to watch a movie, Vice
03:47 < aloo_shu> Mingyur, btw, has a lot of neuroscience explained, too, albeit in tibetan buddhism context
03:48 < aloo_shu> but Liedloff, The Continuum Concept, paints the evolutive picture, is behaviouristic in perspective, and a very good read, too
03:50 < dioz> do they have pictures?
03:50 < dioz> jk
03:50 < aloo_shu> no
03:50 < dioz> i started reading the continuum concept

03:53 < stefycute> O.o
03:53 < stefycute> Y
03:54 < stefycute> I understand the first topics i got lost on quantity
03:55 < stefycute> Aside from the subject being taken from kant
03:55 < chu> I would suggest you need to revisist the first topics if you think you understood them.
03:55 < stefycute> What the pure beings?
03:55 < stefycute> He was talking bout the ego and the seperation of it from our mind means pure beings
03:56 < stefycute> Thats the gist of it
03:56 < stefycute> im lost on quantity
03:56 < stefycute> I dont get it
03:57 < stefycute> Any ideas or clues to help me understand it?
03:59 < aloo_shu> quantity as opposed to quality? admittedly guessing
03:59 < stefycute> Yeah
04:01 < stefycute> how bout the rest of what he is saying?
04:04 < stefycute> I know physically applies but how bout mentally?
04:06 < aloo_shu> I was just guessing from context, but I don't know your text - or any hegel text, for that matter

06:46 < aloo_shu> thought i was banned for some reason, maybe it concerned my impersonator aloo_shu2 that was also me, from a second client before freenode had noticed the 1st client was gone

06:50 < aloo_shu> at least 10 min ago, I was

06:51 < aloo_shu> what happened?
06:53 < aloo_shu> here, one moblie device went down w/ empty batt, and I had my spare fired up before freenode had a ping timeout, so my client must have been told aloo_shu weren't available, hence aloo_shu2

07:22 < arryana> it'll be ten years before people want to live there
07:23 < arryana> from where i sit, they owned the house, they insured it for its worth.  they should be given its worth to do with what they will.

07:28 < arryana> that's a bold choice.
07:29 < arryana> my mother is terminal, and living in another country, so i fly every three months or so.

07:31 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: I think “AFK” is super common
07:31 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: I speak by my mother by skype a lot, but have not visited her in many many years in person
07:31 < arryana> my mother is too technophobic for skype
07:31 < arryana> she never even learned to work a vcr
07:31 < amigojapan_bnc> I am on the other side of the world
07:32 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: I have my cousing put skype on for her, she does not actually do anything but speak on it
07:32 < arryana> there's nobody there for her to do such things.  it's nice that your mom has support.
07:33 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: also, teamviewer so I can just do everything once she is online
07:33  * arryana nods
07:33 < amigojapan_bnc> yup
07:34 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: could she open the cover of a laptop?   I think anyone can do that, and you can do everything else remotely, all she needs to do is open it and close it
07:34 < aloo_shu> actually the fact I'm on irc is related to my mum, who's also in a different country from mine. I'd never have bought a SIM card for my phone if it weren't for a crisis when I wanted to call my mum frequently.
07:34 < arryana> you should really meet my mom before you advise.
07:34 < amigojapan_bnc> aloo_shu: home she is ok
07:34 < arryana> she's exceedingly resistant
07:34 < arryana> and i have no wish to torment a dying woman by demanding she do things she's afraid of
07:34 < arryana> it would be cruel
07:34 < amigojapan_bnc> ok arryana , I see
07:35 < arryana> she can't see much, her hands do not function well.
07:36 < amigojapan_bnc> I see
07:36 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: you do well in caring so much about your mom,  many people dont care at all
07:37 < arryana> she's my mother.  she can be a right pain in the ass, but can't we all.
07:37 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: and I belieev these kinds of relationships are because we use our emotions and not our reason,   reason leads many people to be indifferent and cold

08:08 < amigojapan_bnc> 16 by now
08:08 < amigojapan_bnc> yeah, I cant complain much
08:08 < arryana> i've never lived anywhere fifteen years
08:08 < amigojapan_bnc> ofcourse every place has pluses and minuses, but i liek Japan
08:08 < arryana> hell, i don't think i've ever lived anywhere five years running
08:08 < arryana> maybe five
08:09 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: I lived 19 years in Mexico, 5 years in USA and 16 years in Japan
08:09 < arryana> i've heard mexico is beautiful as well.  my boss's housekeeper has a house there
08:09 < willc> amigojapan_bnc, what are your cell phone data plans like? I ask because a lot of streamers on Twitch are constantly streaming and they are usually in Japan. They appear to have unlimited data.
08:09 < arryana> i'm trying to remember where
08:10 < arryana> i've only been once, and i remember very little of it
08:10 < arryana> it was a late night drunken trip to tijuana
08:10 < willc> I would like to visit Japan. Always been on the list of places I'd like to visit.
08:10 < amigojapan_bnc> willc: yeah, I have a special plan even for Japan, unlimited data for onlky like 140 USD per year
08:11 < willc> 140 per year? whhaaattt
08:11 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: tijuana is not a nice part of Mexico
08:11 < amigojapan_bnc> yup willc
08:11 < willc> Canada is >$100 for a month for 1-2gb lol
08:11 < arryana> i've heard that all japanese cellphones have camera shutter noises that can't be disabled, so people can't take sneaky photos
08:11 < arryana> i have no idea if that's true, though
08:11 < amigojapan_bnc> willc: yup, in Japan there are plans like that, I got mine after shopping around a lot
08:12 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: yeah, it is also against the law to mute your camera shutter
08:12 < arryana> i think that's brilliant
08:13 < arryana> i can't think of any good reason a camera should be silent
08:13 < arryana> and at least one good reason why it shouldn't
08:13 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: well, with silent cameras people use it to take pictures of panties and whatnot
08:13 < arryana> ew.
08:13 < arryana> some people need help.
08:13 < arryana> the expensive kind/
08:13 < amigojapan_bnc> on crowded trains
08:14 < arryana> i'm surprised girls and women don't wear the sort of shorts cheerleaders wear under their skirts.
08:16 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: yeah, also in Japan women still wear dresses
08:16 < willc> So from some research, apparently I should get a friend in the US to get me a cell phone plan and I pay them. I can get unlimited US/CA for $86/month
08:16 < arryana> women in england seem to wear dresses more than americans as well.
08:17 < arryana> though not me personally
08:17 < amigojapan_bnc> willc: do you guys have T-mobile?
08:17 < willc> Newp

08:19 < Elegrant> arryana, the dress is coming back in fashion for boys
08:20 < arryana> may they have the joy of them.
08:21 < arryana> i never much got the appeal.
08:22 < amigojapan_bnc> the dress is the main thing for women in Japan, only old women wear pants
08:24 < arryana> well, i'm an old woman, so that works for me
08:26 < amigojapan_bnc> I am almost 40, but I dont think I am “old"

08:48 < amigojapan_bnc> willc: I dont think there is anything reallly hardware-wise that is wrong with the iphone 4s, all the problems i have is from software stopping support
08:48 < therue2> can someone recommend some good introductory books to Carl Jung? before actually diving head first into his actual work which i hear can be rather daunting

09:04 < stefycute> Being with old ppl make you feel young
09:04 < oy> old? who you calling old?
09:04 < stefycute> Italian ppl
09:04 < watom> i'm already a ghost
09:04 < stefycute> 34
09:04 < watom> i don't age anymore
09:04 < arryana> i dig getting older.
09:05 < arryana> it's underrated
09:05 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: what was your first computer? the first one i used was a vic-20, the first one I owned was a 286
09:05 < oy> age obsession is often the neurosis of the 20 something
09:05 < arryana> my first computer was a commodore 64
09:05 < arryana> but i got a trs-80 soon after
09:05 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: so I used a computer from before yours at school
09:05 < oy> they know they are already, or soon, over the hill, hence they fret
09:05 < arryana> i also owned a 1978 hewlett packard dumb terminal with a 9600 baud modem
09:05 < stefycute> I dont remember the name i just know it has dos
09:05 < watom> oy i'm with you on that
09:05 < watom> when you start to feel old i bad
09:05 < watom> is
09:06 < watom> is like you realize your will time will end
09:06 < watom> as young you don't care much
09:06 < arryana> though to be fair, when i got the commie, he only had a 300 baud modem
09:06 < stefycute> And playex prince of persia with it
09:06 < arryana> at the time most things could only handle 300 anyway
09:06 < watom> 20-30 is traumatic
09:06 < arryana> that'd have been... 1984 or so
09:06 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: “old/young” is in the mind
09:06 < watom> than you start thinking again your infinite
09:06 < watom> sure.
09:07 < watom> but it's more about the time going away
09:07 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: I assume I am still young cause I still watch anime :)
09:07 < watom> i watch anime sometimes
09:07 < watom> i should check the new season
09:07  * arryana is more of the rick-and-morty sort
09:07 < watom> that too
09:07 < watom> i'm not on any sort
09:07 < watom> i'm mixed
09:08 < oy> they don't yet realize life is a series of blips, and that it's over in a heartbeat
09:08 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: if you wanta philosophical anime that is being remade in this season, sech “kino no tabi”  “kino’s journey”
09:08 < watom> a bit of everything
09:08 < watom> let me check amigojapan_bnc
09:08 < stefycute> Watch x samurai
09:08 < stefycute> Learned a lot with that anime
09:08 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: then I woudl suggest watching also Xavier Renegade angel , it is all on oytubem if you like RIck and Morty. it is made by the same writer
09:09 < watom> thank you amigojapan_bnc i will try to watch http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/kinos-journey-the-beautiful-world-the-animated-series
09:09 < oy> Samurai X, Rurouni Kenshin is pretty good
09:09 < arryana> oh yeah?  i'll give that a look, thanks
09:09 < stefycute> yes loved it
09:09 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: thanks :) let me know if you like it
09:09 < stefycute> it talks about wars and how it works i still think its still like that
09:09 < oy> I will rewatch it when I begin study of Japanese
09:10 < stefycute> Cool
09:10 < stefycute> Your studying japanese
09:10 < oy> I'm about to.
09:10 < amigojapan_bnc> oy: dont put it off, study as soona s you can
09:10 < stefycute> i love to too
09:10 < watom> is Samurai X only OVA?
09:10 < arryana> i need to catch up on the last few 'new' rick and mortys, but i promised to watch them with my younger boss
09:10  * amigojapan_bnc is fluent in Japanese
09:10 < watom> i found 2+4 + a movie
09:10 < oy> watom: no it's a long series called Rurouni Kenshin
09:11 < stefycute> i only know profane words from watching anime in original and subtitles
09:11 < watom> got it with that name
09:11 < watom> 94 eps gosh
09:11 < watom> i don't have the time
09:11 < oy> I just love Japanese culture.
09:11 < amigojapan_bnc> oy: you know Japanese cultur is very different from anime I hope
09:11 < watom> is the movie a recap? maybe i try that one
09:12 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: there is also a live action movie of ruroni kenshin
09:12 < watom> nope. the movie is bad commented
09:12 < oy> amigojapan_bnc: Yes. :-) people aren't cartoons irl
09:12 < amigojapan_bnc> my wife is a huge ruroni kenshin fan
09:12 < stefycute> I guess the language can improve my brain
09:12 < amigojapan_bnc> alright oy , that was kindof a mistake I made when I first came to Japan
09:12 < watom> i don't like original material
09:12 < watom> except a bit of english
09:13 < stefycute> Coz its different from english but i need to relearn grammar coz i suck at it
09:13 < watom> i feel a more deeper experience in my language
09:13 < watom> and i'd hate to read while watching
09:13 < watom> like i can't just pay attention to the image
09:13 < watom> and the sound
09:13 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: what is your language?
09:13 < watom> italian
09:13 < amigojapan_bnc> I see
09:13 < watom> doesn't matter
09:14 < amigojapan_bnc> watom: I bet ruroni kenshin must be somehow available in Italian
09:14 < stefycute> Ur italian? O.o
09:14 < watom> yes stefycute
09:14 < watom> we discovered that few days later
09:14 < stefycute> o.o
09:14 < watom> before*
09:14 < watom> when you said your net suck
09:14 < watom> and i said i've got fiber
09:14 < oy> watom: what do you call a one-armed Italian?
09:14 < watom> uhm
09:14 < watom> disabled?
09:14 < oy> A guy with a speech impediment.
09:14 < arryana> that joke is even older than i am
09:15  * oy shrugs 
09:15 < oy> so mote it be
09:15  * arryana pokes it with her cane while squinting at it suspiciously
09:15 < watom> i don't even get it
09:15 < arryana> he's saying italians gesture a lot with their hands when they speak
09:15 < stefycute> Where in italy?
09:16 < watom> even if the case
09:16 < watom> is fine
09:16 < stefycute> If u dont mind me asking
09:16 < watom> i mind :')
09:16 < watom> lol
09:16 < stefycute> okay o.o
09:16 < watom> arryana gesturing is fine. it help to explain
09:16 < arryana> indeed
09:16 < oy> sociopaths also tend to gesture a lot, Dr Robert Hare says
09:16 < watom> ahah
09:17 < stefycute> Yeah thats y its no use for italians to use headphones while driving
09:17 < watom> the only reason you odn't gesture a lot
09:17 < watom> i think is that they educated you
09:17 < watom> to stop doing it
09:17 < watom> when you were young
09:17 < watom> since is a pretty natural think to do
09:17 < oy> they use the hand gestures for emphasis, misdirection etc.
09:17 < watom> thing
09:17 < stefycute> They will crash anyway
09:17 < watom> if you teach you know that gestures matters
09:17 < amigojapan_bnc> I wonder if Romans used lots of hand gestures
09:17 < stefycute> *flops*lol
09:17 < watom> and they complete the communication
09:18 < oy> since their emotional life is flat, this gesturing helps mask some of the lack of emotionality
09:18 < watom> oy i don't agree...
09:18 < watom> is just you trying to get out
09:18 < stefycute> they dont notice it
09:18 < watom> of yourself
09:18 < stefycute> And they kiss guyz on the cheeks

09:19 < oy> watom: que?
09:19 < watom> and again. i believe where people use no gestures
09:19 < watom> it's about education
09:19 < willc> g'night phellow filohophers
09:19 < watom> they will tell you is a bad thing
09:19 < watom> and you will stop
09:19 < stefycute> nah
09:19 < stefycute> Its funny
09:19 < oy> none of what you say contradicts the premise of Hare
09:19 < stefycute> If an english comes here when all things fail use hand gesture
09:20 < oy> i.e. that sociopaths are statistically more prone to excessive gesturing
09:20 < watom> ok sociopaths tend to gesture. but if you gesture you're not a sociopath
09:20 < watom> :')
09:20 < oy> No, no, I'm actualy claiming that all italians are sociopaths *facepalms*
09:20 < oy> oops I just made a gesture
09:20 < watom> gestures is a local thing anyway
09:20 < watom> not a national one
09:21 < watom> but if you're out of italy you will gesture since bad lang
09:21 < stefycute> It is

09:21 < watom> well i will not let grow common places
09:21 < watom> i'm out
09:22 < stefycute> I dont notice if i do it when speaking english i need to see it and notice it
09:22 < watom> most of the times i gesture i want to gesture
09:22 < watom> or i just don't
09:22 < watom> i'm pretty self-aware
09:22 < oy> watom: Your English is a bit wobbly
09:23 < amigojapan_bnc> in Japan it is common that people bow while speaking on the phone
09:23 < stefycute> its cool
09:23 < watom> i know
09:23 < watom> i just read in english
09:23 < watom> and i'm on freenode since software
09:23 < arryana> thinking on it, my hands are occupied most of the time.  when i'm talking i'm usually either cooking or knitting
09:23 < arryana> or mending something
09:24 < watom> oy it's like made by experience
09:24 < stefycute> U look at the window and see people driving with head phones and one hand they are geaturing and the other trying to drive

09:24 < stefycute> and italians drive fast
09:24 < stefycute> Never follow the speed limit
09:25 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: you probably are using too many stereotypes
09:25 < stefycute> They always go faster so i would say all italians have broke the law so many times
09:25 < watom> we are in philoosphy
09:25 < watom> not in culture
09:25 < stefycute> its not included?
09:26 < arryana> i had a psychology and sociology professor give a really amazing demonstration on that.
09:26 < amigojapan_bnc> on what arryana ?
09:26 < arryana> there were maybe 45 of us in the lecture hall, and she had us all call out lists of things which were 'true of people'
09:26 < watom> arryana tell more
09:26 < arryana> two eyes, two legs, etc
09:26 < arryana>  she got a list of maybe 50 attributes
09:27 < arryana> then she took us to a tall building (we were in new york city) and had us sit near the observation windows
09:27 < arryana> it did not take long before the first legless man came by
09:27 < binarycat> I hate it when three rich people get together and fund a $1,500,000,000 masterpiece film with the best and most original story and acting ever put on film, and watch it together one time in a special movie theater and then destroy the only copy of the film so it's lost forever, and require all people involved to sign NDAs so they cannot use any ideas or work put into the movie. They are now the only three people in the world who has seen that
09:27 < binarycat> movie, and nobody else ever will.
09:27 < arryana> then a man with one arm.
09:27 < arryana> a man with no hair, a woman missing a hand
09:27 < watom> binarycat example?
09:28 < binarycat> watom: This kind of thing never becomes news/known, obviously.
09:28 < arryana> it became clear that once you are talking about a social sample larger than 1000 or so people, very few generalities are true
09:28 < watom> i see
09:28 < watom> yeah
09:28 < watom> just comon places
09:28 < arryana> which made her point brilliantly, and instilled a horror in me of all 'this entire population is x'
09:28 < watom> yeah
09:28 < watom> is just a belief
09:28 < watom> based on our local experience
09:28 < amigojapan_bnc> binarycat: sounds like an urban legend
09:28 < watom> and our personal story
09:29 < arryana> because if you're talking about 100 people, chances are you'll be wrong.
09:29 < arryana> and out of 10,000, it certainly will be
09:29 < stefycute> Im kinda cold in some part
09:30 < stefycute> People usually just touch the surface of the truth but never the whole truth
09:30 < arryana> binarycat, i don't imagine such is a problem often.
09:30 < watom> i think common places are just bad thinking outcome
09:30 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: apparently Plato gave a definition of a human as “a hariless biped” and then Diogenese plucked the feathers off a chicken and said “I brought a human “
09:30 < stefycute> Like christians blaming god or complaining bcoz their life suck
09:30 < watom> if you consider facts in the right way
09:30 < arryana> hahah
09:30 < watom> you will not generalize a lot of stuff
09:30 < watom> and you will prevent common places
09:30 < arryana> that's brilliant, amigo
09:30 < amigojapan_bnc> :) arryana
09:31 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: Diogenese really hated Plato, and said that it was bad to think in such abstract ways as he did
09:31  * arryana repeats amigo's post to her friend in the other room and gets laughter

09:36 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: no, life could not really be fair,  for example there would be people born with malformities
09:36 < amigojapan_bnc> hi dto
09:37 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: we may be able to distribute wealth better, that is true,      but some things are out of our control
09:37 < arryana> 'fair' is a concept most people take out of perspective.  dogs are aware if you give one of them more than another, and recognize it as 'unfair'. but the idea that anyone is entitled to a universal anything is nonsense.
09:37 < stefycute> Nope not when the population number get stable it wont happen
09:38 < stefycute> And start eating good food
09:38 < stefycute> It can

09:43 < arryana> i've hunted and eaten my dinner too many times to be precious about it,

09:45 < arryana> i don't take the shot if i'm not sure.
09:45 < stefycute> True but humans were never meant to eat meat
09:45 < arryana> our teeth say otherwisd
09:45 < arryana> we do not have the teeth of herbivores
09:45 < arryana> nor the digestions
09:46 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: I have a pet rabbit that I may eventually need to put it down, it is already 11 years old, but I am affraid to make it suffer instead of being able to kill it with one blow…. any recommendations?
09:46 < stefycute> I can understand ages ago but now we have all the technology we need to survive without killing animals or insects
09:46 < arryana> if it is a pet, i would take it to the vet to be humanely put to sleep
09:46 < stefycute> It because a body can adapt
09:46 < amigojapan_bnc> ok, I see arryana
09:47 < stefycute> Like some stomach cant digest salads anymore because they always eat cook food
09:47 < arryana> when i lived in very remote areas with my pets, i kept a hunting arrow in case one was wounded and had to be killed, but i never had to use it.
09:47 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: the reason I ask is cause my wife will probably not want me to do that, and I think  maybe if I can put him out myself, I can do it withought tellign my wife I did it
09:47 < arryana> i'm happy to take the financial hit to give them a quiet end
09:48 < arryana> oh.  i don't know of any painless way to kill a pet.
09:48 < arryana> not a way that's equally gentle as euthanizing them
09:48 < amigojapan_bnc> I see arryana , thanks
09:48 < arryana> i had a similar problem with my ex-husband over the wolf
09:48 < arryana> he refused to let me put her to sleep when she was elderly and ill
09:49 < arryana> so i took her to the vet 'for a checkup', and when they said she was in terrible shape (which i knew), i told them to put her down gently.
09:49 < arryana> he didn't forgive me, but she didn't suffer
09:49 < arryana> i'll take the heat for that.  she earned it.
09:49 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: I wonder why we all mostlyk agree about euthinasia when it comes to animals, but many people that woudl agree with ti for an animal, are against for a human

09:50 < arryana> well, i'm pro euthanasia for humans too, so long as it isn't because they're inconvenient.
09:50 < arryana> making the sick and elderly disposable is not an option
09:50 < amigojapan_bnc> no, I mean because they are suffering only
09:50 < arryana> but i don't think suffering should be required in the cases where that's all the quality of life to be had.
09:51 < amigojapan_bnc> yeah, I guess we agree then
09:51 < arryana> we all owe each other a little more than that, i think.
09:51 < amigojapan_bnc> in the case of an animal it is easier to be less bias I guess
09:52 < stefycute> Quick and painless you mean?
09:53 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: altho I will dmit I almost made a mistake with the rabbit, I thought it was not eating anymore because of it’s  old age, it had lost lots of hair too,  but we were able to get it to eat again…. so I was mistaken that it was already too late
09:53 < arryana> perhaps a good vet could tell you what sort of needs it has
09:54 < arryana> i had a ferret for ten years, i still miss him every day
09:54 < arryana> he was a marvelous fellow
09:54 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: yeah,   did not even need a vet,  the pet shop told me to feed it hay, cause when rabbits have a stomach problem they need ot eat hay, and that worked
09:56 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: yeah, we are talkign abotu how to kill an animal quckly and painlessly when it is just suffering
09:56 < stefycute> some things never change
09:56 < arryana> rabbits aren't pets i've kept.  dogs, cats, birds, the ferret, and wolves
09:56 < lakitu> rabbits should always eat hay; timothy hay, it's called.
09:56 < Elegrant> and I say hey, what a wonderful kind of rabbit hay
09:56 < stefycute> Never had a pet
09:56 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: well, this rabbit survived a long time withought eating hay
09:56 < stefycute> Personally so i wouldnt understand

09:58 < amigojapan_bnc> arryana: is a wolf any less friendly to humans than a normal dog?
09:58 < amigojapan_bnc> less domesticatable?
09:58 < Elegrant> philosophilistinian rebels
09:59 < arryana> some of them are.  mine were carefully socialized
09:59 < stefycute> Hey elgrant what do u think about hegel and quantity i heard ur in good terms with him
09:59 < amigojapan_bnc> I see arryana
09:59 < lakitu> rabbits weren't domesticated till about 600 years ago. i think dogs, 10,000
09:59 < arryana> my first wolf loved everyone.  the second was not crazy about kids
09:59 < Elegrant> stefycute, eh I know a bit of him I guess
10:00 < lakitu> i saw something recently that dogs come from a breed of wolf that had a 'super friendly gene' anomaly. some humans have it; it's like you become super super social & friendly
10:00 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: how do you know? I dont think written text goes back 10,000 years
10:00 < lakitu> records, bones, taht sort of thing

10:00 < lakitu> you are right. i heard written texts go back 6,000
10:01 < Elegrant> quantity is counted repetition
10:01 < stefycute> oooo
10:01 < lakitu> altho a piece of wood with notches for keeping phases of the moon found was 30,000 years old
10:01 < stefycute> Hail elegrant
10:01 < Elegrant> counted by way of relation if not by way of subtraction
10:01 < stefycute> Now the jump
10:01 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: ah ok, yeah, that is much  easier than developing writing

10:02 < lakitu> not too unrelated.
10:02 < arryana> in my admittedly limited experience, i'd say that as long as a wolf puppy is raised in a pack setting, it will obey the pack rules
10:02 < arryana> human or wolf
10:03 < amigojapan_bnc> I see arryana
10:03 < lakitu> i'd be curious to find 'intra' history developments - first ancestry, first inventory, first written law
10:03 < lakitu> i think the code of hammurabi is the first written law
10:03 < lakitu> in Ur(?)
10:03 -!- kishore96 [~kishore@103.65.196.10] has quit [Quit: Konversation terminated!]
10:03 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: what was the first writing in record?
10:04 < lakitu> no idea & i'd guess likely-disputed
10:04 < amigojapan_bnc> I see
10:04 < lakitu> maybe not - with chemical analysis
10:04 < stefycute> No idea bout pets im allergic to animal hair
10:04 < lakitu> but i think you have stuff on caves before paper
10:05 < arryana> i think the problem they'll have is -finding- the oldest writing.
10:05 < stefycute> Altho i would like a cat huge as a big dog
10:05 < arryana> less than determining the age of things found
10:05 < stefycute> Or a husky
10:05 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: I find it interesting how apparently in all religious holy texts , the writers appear to have thought it was ok to write about mythology as if it was true, I guess maybe they believed it was true themesleves, and then back then nobody seemed to question it
10:06 < stefycute> Nope it was analogy
10:06 < Elegrant> cat luge
10:06 < stefycute> Only way to explain things
10:06 < stefycute> Like science
10:06 < lakitu> the Vedas were originally oral history only
10:06 < stefycute> Before chemistry was magic
10:06 < Elegrant> and before magic was positivism
10:07 < stefycute> or changing elements now it has a scientific explaination
10:07  * lakitu not Hindu
10:07 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: we wtill have tribes in the amazon who have not adopted writing (as of now)
10:07 < Elegrant> stefycute, we ontologised the kind of being that can be quantified and put into predictive laws
10:08 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, why write when you can magically telepathically converse in mind-song?

10:09 < amigojapan_bnc> I wonder why people still take writtings that are 6000 years old seriously
10:09 < stefycute> What?
10:09 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, serious for what?
10:09 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I mean, why we dont discard them as “this was the childhood of humanity”
10:10 < stefycute> Yeah now we have keyboards
10:10 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: like, I would not take something I wrote when I was 8 years old, and take it very seriously now
10:10 < lakitu> haha
10:11 < Elegrant> that's too bad, because it has deathly consequences
10:11 < stefycute> its because some text can be studied and teach us something only problem is we need to have the key to translate and decodeit
10:11 < lakitu> well, new & improved usually loses to tried & true
10:11 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: no, humans knwo much more now than we did 6000 years ago
10:12 < lakitu> that is life lesson - or at least for me it was one
10:12 < stefycute> Like the book of enoch?
10:12 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: but most of the old stuff is not true
10:12 < Elegrant> we probably have a better idea of the extent of our ignorance and the spurious contingency of being at the moment
10:12 < lakitu> i really doubt 'most' of what our ancestors wrote down was not true
10:12 < Elegrant> but at the same time this knowledge was more unconscious maybe 6000 years ago
10:12 < stefycute> you do know our knowledge didnt advance much?
10:12 < Elegrant> so maybe there's still things we can learn from these people regarding things we are more consciously thinking about
10:13 < stefycute> Ancient maya know astronomy better than us and they didnt have the technology think about that
10:13 < lakitu> do you imagine they were dumb schmucks who couldn't form a sentence properly, dribbled at the mouth when they ate - ?
10:13 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: I think most of what they wrote down was not true, come on, they wrot about dragons, and unicorns, and lots of other imaginary mosnters as if they were real
10:13 < stefycute> So there is something they have we are missing
10:13 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, they were
10:14 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: nah
10:14 < Elegrant> the mysteries of the ancient Egyptians were mysteries to the Ancient Egyptians themselves
10:14 < lakitu> you are not being put in charge of our history dept., haha
10:14 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, these creatures existed
10:14 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: yup, and that is a shame
10:14 < lakitu> (amigo - i'm jesting, too)
10:14 < amigojapan_bnc> haha ok lakitu :)
10:14 < Elegrant> this was a different form of animal kingdom I think
10:15 < Elegrant> one that wasn't so detailed and stickler for accuracy as the one we have now
10:15 < stefycute> I was just saying if they can do that without technology like today we should be traveling with space craft and using telephaty sadly with greed we didnt evolve much
10:15 < stefycute> And italy is proof of tha
10:15 < amigojapan_bnc> lakitu: I would put a warning on all ancient texts saying “this was written before we even knew the difference between fantasy and reality”    , that is what I woudl do if I was put in charge of the history department :)
10:16 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, reality is structured by fantasy
10:17 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: speak for yourself
10:17 < Elegrant> a 'dragon' may well have been a very real, substantive thing back then, just as today Google or WASPs are very real and variously tangible things
10:18 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: it is not impossible, but most likely people just wrote down stuff they heard form their grandmother, and it was not real
10:18 < Elegrant> a dragon if not a literal creature may have been a phantom excess of their system of natural biosis
10:19 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, you think the grandmother is bullshitting?
10:19 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: after all, they did not know better
10:19 < stefycute> Sigh internet suck
10:19 < Elegrant> it has weight, these signifiers
10:19 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant no, the grandmother is just passing down what she thought was what her grandmother said
10:19 < Elegrant> there is a reason dragon and other mythical creatures are represented and disproportionately
10:20 < Elegrant> its not just 'what a good story grandmother, ha ha'
10:20 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: it is probably just that dragons ar eliek the tooth fairy and the mother goose, that is what I think….
10:20 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, yes and what survives the telephone game-chain is a certain structural crick, tethered by certain key signifiers
10:21 < stefycute> Dragon-water serpent-god-snake-kundalini-third eye-medusa-ra-etc....
10:22 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, they might have been hang-abouts from a bygone pagan gods era
10:22 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: there are certain myths adults tell children, like the tooth fairy and santaclause, and there are other myths adults tell adults like YHWH and Zeus
10:22 < Elegrant> at time when these 'gods' had some actuality to everyday reality, but being left behind as residue of a time and mode of thought passed and yet not totally shaken off
10:23 < stefycute> what is myth really?arent they just the same story repeated in different versions?
10:23 < stefycute> Hercules half mortal
10:23 < stefycute> Jesus christ half mortal
10:23 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I think, right now is a time I may be ready to discard old stories as mythical, and move on with what I can see to be real in my reality around me
10:23 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, and all can be valid and true
10:23 < Elegrant> and because of, not in spite of, their mythical status
10:24 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: but it is most likely that they are not true, given what we can observe about santaclause and the tooth fairy
10:24 < stefycute> Three gods zeus neptune and hades
10:24 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, what is real in this reality?
10:24 < stefycute> Three gods sounds like trinity
10:24 < Elegrant> the real is in how this reality fails, breaks down
10:24 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: it is funny that even in the bible they still use the word “hades”
10:25 < stefycute> Ring any bells?
10:25 < stefycute> True the keys of hades
10:25 < stefycute> Of death
10:25 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: thinsg I can see , liek ariplanes , cars, computers, people, those are the things I take to be my faith…. I believe in them…. those are the thingsw I allow my faith in “reality being rel” to be the basis for my faith
10:26 < stefycute> Death hades neptune is water so it should be life but zeus is electricity and he is the boss of all Gods
10:26 < stefycute> Lol
10:26 < stefycute> Sounds like the future
10:26 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, so you're limited to what capitalism makes real?
10:27 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: in simpler words, I udnerstand i need a certain ammout of faith to say “reality is real”
10:27 < stefycute> i dont believe in capitalism
10:27 < stefycute> Technology is zeus lol i didnt get it lol
10:27 < stefycute> Sorry guyz connecting dots
10:27 < Elegrant> stefycute, the beauty of capitalism is it works best when nobody thinks they believe in it
10:27 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: ummm,    well,to what I can observe easily, I know I can be wrong, but I think I can have a closer grasp of it
10:28 < Elegrant> the belief operates even if nobody believes in it
10:28 < stefycute> I dont believe it has a future
10:28 < Elegrant> the child believes in santa for parents, the parents 'believe' in it for child, nobody is believing first-hand but the story operates and has material efficacy
10:28 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: yeah, I am aware of things like “fiat money only has value because people believe in it"
10:29 < Elegrant> no, it only has value because nobody believes in it first-hand
10:29 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I think the story of santa is important for kids to see how something false can be actually faked to be true…. it is important that we keep on teaching “santa is real”
10:29 < Elegrant> they know very well that its bullshit but nonetheless they act as if its real
10:29 < amigojapan_bnc> brb, bathroom
10:30 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, yes, but also as a marker of immanent ommunism in capitalism
10:31 < Elegrant> *immanent communism
10:31 < Elegrant> that is, why stop at one gift-giving day (or season) a year? Let's just go full gift economy
10:33 < amigojapan_bnc> back
10:33 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I dont believe in giving gifts even in christmass, I just go along with it cause my family demands it
10:34 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I woudl give htingws they need anyway, regardless of season
10:34 < amigojapan_bnc> things*
10:34 < Elegrant> well I meant more a system of economy where everything is provided for
10:34 < amigojapan_bnc> but christmas is abotu giving thinsg people dont need, I dont like it
10:35 < Elegrant> well that's what it's become yes
10:35 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: yeah, I think I am for somethign like that,  but many americans are brainwashed against it
10:35 < Elegrant> I fear we may be threatening the christmas spirit
10:35 < Elegrant> but nobody wants to brainwash them out of it?
10:36 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I think the best step would be to give everyone a basic income, something so that work becomes optional
10:36 < Elegrant> yes perhaps, but the problem is also this issue of work
10:37 < Elegrant> that is, work in how it is structured today
10:37 < Elegrant> of course with basic income that would necessitate a change in how we structure work, but enough of one?
10:38 < Elegrant> There will be class issues with this if its not worked out properly, and then you have the issue of people not wanting to give mass power to governments anymore
10:39 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: also, the basic income needs to be adjusted to living expenses of hte time , otherwise it will just be a joke like “minimum wage”
10:39 < stefycute> I didnt want my son to believe in santa but i have a solution for that hehehe....
10:40 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: you NEED to tell you son santa is real,    it is very nessesary to develop a healthy skeptical mind
10:40 < stefycute> Ofc
10:40 < stefycute> ^^
10:41 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: it is nessesary to think “oh everything everyone ever told me was a lie"
10:41 < stefycute> He already know mr. Snowman
10:41 < stefycute> It wouldnt be difficult
10:41 < Elegrant> ah but does Santa know he isn't real
10:41 < stefycute> But im saying the truth
10:41 < amigojapan_bnc> lying to children is nessesary
10:41 < stefycute> My santa wears a mask
10:42 < stefycute> Thus the truth
10:42 < Elegrant> stefycute, make him wear a red balaclava
10:42 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: it is not good to teach only the truth to a child,  then he wont be prepared for when someone lies to him
10:42 < Elegrant> Santa as Christmas burglar
10:43 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: also, it is no good that a child trusts his parents 100%
10:43 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, its not good to tell the truth when we lie to a child
10:43 < stefycute> he only needs ppl who care about him to tell him the truth
10:44 < stefycute> he is four going five
10:44 < stefycute> And i dont always let him win
10:44  * amigojapan_bnc has told his son “never trust anything I say”
10:44 < stefycute> And my brother steals his cookies
10:44 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, that's damaging
10:44 < stefycute> I think he gets the gist
10:44 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: it is true,  he should not trust what I say
10:44 < Elegrant> there needs to be moments where a son can trust in a father
10:44 < Elegrant> or parent figure
10:45 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, and trust whom instead?
10:45 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I am a liar, and blindly trusting me is not a good idea
10:45 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: nobody blinedly
10:45 < stefycute> im bit strict in some part he is still small but when he gets older training starts
10:45 < Elegrant> just saying don't trust me is like saying trust Hillary Duff or Milo Yianopolous or something
10:46 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I just mean it as “trust nobody not even me”

10:47 < Elegrant> well maybe if we could be open about it, it could work
10:47 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: it is just being realistic
10:47 < stefycute> Saying dont trust me means for ur safety dont trust ne coz i might do things that will hurt u either for concern for u and safety for u or i didnt do it purposely
10:47 < stefycute> Thus those words
10:47 < stefycute> Atleast u r prepared to get hurt
10:47 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: I just recently got an aopology from someone telling me i was right, and the person he thought was his lover was just a scammer
10:47 < Elegrant> you should say "Don't trust me unless I really deserve it"
10:47 < stefycute> Than believing u will never get hurt when u will
10:48 < stefycute> Idk
10:48 < stefycute> I think low of myself
10:48 < amigojapan_bnc> me too stefycute
10:48 < stefycute> So i just say dont trust me
10:48 < Elegrant> yeah but who else is the kid gonna trust
10:48 < stefycute> Up to ppl to see to trust me or not
10:48 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: probably what stefycute is saying is clse to me, I dont trust myself, so I tell my son not ot trust me

10:50 < stefycute> Oh i trust myself not on other cases but when it comes to emergencies i trust my instinct
10:50 < Elegrant> Of course maybe it depends on the way you say 'don't trust me'
10:50 < Elegrant> if its spelled out its a sort of "people lie, I lie" thing then that's fine
10:50 < stefycute> what did i do to my son?
10:50 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: that was my intention
10:51 < Elegrant> stefycute, only time will toll
10:51 < stefycute> Hey ppl going to use him so its better he learn to trust himself
10:51 < stefycute> Then the rest will unfold
10:52 < amigojapan_bnc> I think my lack of trust in myself, is only offset a bit by the fact I trust other people even less so than myself
10:52 < stefycute> Lol
10:52 < stefycute> Nah sometimes i trust people more than myself
10:52 < amigojapan_bnc> I dont, I may have trust issues
10:52 < Elegrant> I trust that we are people
10:53 < amigojapan_bnc> stefycute: I told this ro my psychiotirst but he did not seem to think it was a problem
10:53 < stefycute> I trust my brother to break my trust and whatever i say to him he will eventually talk about it to someone else
10:53 < Elegrant> I know that feels
10:54 < Elegrant> but im not exactly an innocent here either
10:54 < jaggz> you should ask Existence to reveal your teacher internally... your guide that, with demonstrated knowledge, saves you from mistakes.
10:54 < stefycute> I know when i walk in the middle of the storm it wont harm me coz i know he will be there and i will be safe
10:55 < stefycute> always knew
10:55 < jaggz> then, one day, that teacher teaches, "when someone misleads you and you find out, you no longer trust that person anymore. but you don't do the same thing with yourself."
10:55 < Elegrant> stefycute, but unfortunately your brother betrays your position to your enemies and they hail down upon you as the true storm?
10:55 < jaggz> you have to learn to focus and use the resources of your mind and body properly
10:56 < stefycute> And i know if i walk inside a pack of wolves he will be by my side coz i trust him and he will be there i know

11:11 < stefycute> Problem solve
11:11 < amigojapan_bnc> Elegrant: actually, I trust someone who says “dont trust me” way way much more than someone who says “I beler lie”   . when was the last time you heard a scammer say “dont trust me”?
11:11 < Elegrant> everytime
11:12 < stefycute> Nope
11:12 < Elegrant> scammers may not need to say it, it is written on their faces or in their materials
11:12 < stefycute> A scammer says trust me
11:12 < stefycute> See?
11:12 < Elegrant> not anymore
11:12 < stefycute> so what do u trust?

11:15 < Elegrant> amigojapan_bnc, I don't have one
11:15 < amigojapan_bnc> alright Elegrant
11:16 < Elegrant> its often not about gaining trust these days but rather gaining carelessness, exploiting vulnerabilties in other forms
11:16 < pug> so advising someone *not to* trust your scam would serve nicely if it impresses sufficiently and promotes the success of some other potential scam.
11:16 < stefycute> Which is?
11:16 < stefycute> Hm?
11:17 < amigojapan_bnc> ok pug , I can see that happening

11:17 < amigojapan_bnc> I mean, I have not seen a scam artist say it, but yeah, I can see how one could
11:18 < pug> politicians do this all the time through misdirecting people's attention to one mess while other, often worse, messes are going on.
11:19 < stefycute> I never trusted a politician
11:19 < amigojapan_bnc> pug: that owuld only be because a truly honest person owuld say “don’t trust me”  , and a scam artist woudl want to seem very honest
11:19 < pug> bullshit used to distract people from other bullshit is a fairly accurate modern picture of political bureaucracy and foreign policy these days, unfortunately.
11:19 < stefycute> Bcoz they dont work for themselves
11:21 < stefycute> Even if they mean what they promise someone on top of the food chain still have control over them
11:21 < pug> amigojapan_bnc: maybe. i'm dishonest and don't think you should trust me but i'm not sure how you could tell whether i'm scamming you or actually honest by admitting dishonesty...
11:21 < pug> lol
11:21 < pug> seems like a troublesome loop.
11:22 < pug> politicians are similarly ambiguous
11:22 < stefycute> U test them
11:22 < amigojapan_bnc> pug: well, I guess you cant,   but it is somethign i say when I am being honest “don7t trust me” or “I am a liar”….  if I wanted to fool osmeone, I would not say that myself
11:22 < stefycute> Simple
11:22 < stefycute> They past the test u know to trust them or not
11:23 < pug> amigojapan_bnc: you might now. :P but because someone like you exists it really just makes it easier for someone like me to use this tactic to convince others of my bullshit.
11:23 < pug> just saying.

11:24 < pug> the sensible knave doesn't take heed of the standards others have unless they'll help further his desired ends.

11:25 < stefycute> idk
11:26 < pug> the truth is only of value to someone like a bullshit artist as a means to some other benefit.
11:26 < stefycute> I just want the rotchild down and live happily ever after
11:26 < stefycute> Thats the gist
11:26 < amigojapan_bnc> ah ok pug , I was only aware of knaves thru the logic game of knights and knaves. I see what you mean now
11:27 < pug> It's worth reading Harry Frankfurt's On Bullshit.
11:27 < stefycute> Im not asking more or anything thats all i want
11:27 < pug> It's a short little essay and he gets at a lot of this.
11:28 < amigojapan_bnc> ok pug , I am googling for it now
11:28 < pug> "On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit" is an interesting follow-up too: http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.html
11:29 < pug> cool thinking. worth contending with or at least considering. :)
11:29 < amigojapan_bnc> pug: it is a bit long,    but I iwll read it, cause this is somethign i am extremly interested in
11:30 < pug> amigojapan_bnc: hopefully it comes in handy.
11:30 < pug> he compares the term bullshit to the older less used phrase "humbug"
11:30 < amigojapan_bnc> pug: BTW,  one of the animes I recommende “Kino no tabi” it so bahhpens they are making a remake, which has at least one ne episode that was not in the original, maybe more

14:08 < Benn> Do I have the free will to will myself into being a dolphin? probably not, that seems beyond the remits of existance as we perceive it
14:09 < Benn> I think people have more free will than they care to admit, they just worry too much about the consequences and instead don't freely will their wills about the place
14:10 < Xenolithic> free will doesn't mean freedom from consequences
14:10 < Benn> That isn't what I said
14:10 < Xenolithic> You said basically that, I was distilling that
14:11 < Benn> No
14:11 < iz> free will also doesn't mean the ability to do the impossible
14:11 < Benn> I was saying people don't use their free will because they fear the consequences
14:11 < Xenolithic> ...right
14:11 < iz> Benn: but they still have it.. they just choose not to use it
14:12 < iz> that's called self-control
14:12 < Benn> Did I say no one has free will?
14:12 < Xenolithic> no, neither did I
14:12 < Xenolithic> why so aggressive?
14:12 < iz> no, but you said something to the effect of "many people have self-control"
14:13 < iz> which I agree with, as it seems to be true
14:14 < Benn> Yes, pretty much
14:18 < inffmus> so
14:18 < inffmus> why do we have free will? if we do?
14:19 < inffmus> how*
14:19 < inffmus> better
14:19 < iz> why don't we?  how wouldn't we have free will?
14:19 < inffmus> what
14:19 < inffmus> how can i be convinced of either
14:19 < inffmus> with such a question
14:19 < iz> if we didn't that would mean everything is predetermined somehow
14:20 < inffmus> right
14:20 < iz> coordinated by a higher power or something
14:20 < inffmus> ?
14:20 < inffmus> why must a higher power be involved
14:20 < iz> how else would everything be predetermined and outside of the control of individual agents?
14:20 -!- KindOne [kindone@freenode/father-christmas/kindone] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
14:21 < inffmus> the world could be 'just like that, and thats it'
14:21 < iz> well, the world would be the higher power then
14:21 < iz> if it can control the fate of everyone within it
14:21 < inffmus> the fate of everyone is a part of the world
14:22 < inffmus> and the world can just be the consequence of other things that are 'just like that'
14:22 < Benn> that's not really an answer though.. 'Well it just is, so there'
14:22 < iz> consequences imply the existance of free will
14:22 < Benn> If we didn't have free will, why would we worry about consequences? It would be out of our control
14:23 < inffmus> Benn could be result of evolution, such that us developed organisms developed the concept of consequence in order to survive better
14:23 < inffmus> Benn and yeah, i am not convinced with that 'it just is' answer too
14:23 < iz> imho, if you consider why free will does exist and why it doesn't exist..  it seems like free will most likely exists.
14:24 < inffmus> iz "imply the existance of free will" why? look at ym evolution example
14:24 < Benn> but why would be survive any better with consequences if we didn't have the free will to make a decision
14:24 < iz> because if you made a choice you had free will
14:24 < Benn> by your logic a species is unable to avoid extinction and survive longer
14:25 < inffmus> Benn i think with evolution you can consider it
14:25 < inffmus> as 'luck'
14:25 < iz> are you saying that evolution makes choices outside of an individual's free-will?  that is an interesting angle
14:25 < inffmus> happening
14:25 < inffmus> i believe that what survives
14:25 < inffmus> is what simply does not die out
14:25 < inffmus> and what random genetic mutation occurs that may benefit the organism
14:25 < inffmus> will keep living
14:25 < inffmus> and thats it
14:26 < inffmus> hence why i am not convinced
14:26 < iz> but why wouldn't that still be pre-detremined
14:26 < inffmus> that our concept of consequences are a result of free will
14:26 < iz> it's not really making choices
14:26 < iz> that's the way it always was suppose to happen
14:26 < inffmus> iz maybe it is pre-determined
14:26 < inffmus> i dont know
14:26 < Benn> Well it's not like as a species we just decide the traits we are given
14:27 < iz> yeah, i think maybe it's impossible to know, but it's fun to think about in different ways
14:27 < Benn> but can evolution have free will? I mean it's a process
14:27 < inffmus> Benn dont think so
14:27 < Benn> it's a process determined by the environment and it's species
14:27 < inffmus> Benn just a result of the 'worlds properties' i think
14:27 < Benn> I don't think it's even relevant to the argument
14:27 < iz> yeah, that's a whole side thought.. does evolution have free-will?
14:27 < inffmus> like physics laws and so on
14:27 < Elegrant> evolution IS free-will
14:27 < iz> but it's an interesting side thought
14:28 < inffmus> Elegrant how
14:28 < Benn> Well evolution isn't a thing that decides stuff.. its just a process to explain 'Stuff dies easier than other stuff so that stuff survives better and parses on its genes to other stuff better'
14:29 < Benn> passes*
14:29 < inffmus> Benn i think it is relevant, i mention it because i am implying that our concept of consquences may just be a result of such traits given
14:29 < inffmus> without the need
14:29 < inffmus> of free will
14:30 < Benn> I think you could definitely argue that my fear of the consequences of eating too many donuts and having a heart attack are kind of moot
14:30 < Benn> as one day I will die
14:30 < iz> that's a good summation of the first "whatever happens it's part of the world" argument
14:30 < iz> and rebuttal to it
14:31 < iz> but i'm still thinking about the "evolution is free-will?" thing
14:31 < inffmus> can explore it a bit if u want
14:32 < inffmus> what i say 'its just part of the world', i mean it in the same way that we describe the world with say, physics laws
14:32 < iz> it's super interesting and i never really thought about it like that before... kinda blowing my mind and i'm not sure where to begin.. so just letting my mind spin on it for a little bit
14:32 < inffmus> pointing to what physics rties to describe
14:32 < inffmus> tries*
14:32 < inffmus> yes its weird
14:32 < inffmus> especially to think
14:32 < inffmus> that organisms survive
14:32 < inffmus> simply by not dying
14:33 < inffmus> and thats the only limit
14:33 < inffmus> not dying out*
14:34 < Benn> I think you have to first consider what is evolution? The gradual change in characteristics across generations of species(at least in regard to what we are talking about)
14:34 < inffmus> but maybe looking at the 'root' of this
14:34 < inffmus> you can find something nice agains tit
14:34 < iz> my first instinct is that there must be something off about that logic..  and that i will quickly figure out what that logic problem is.. but i haven't yet..
14:34 < Benn> there is no real force to evolution itself
14:34 < Benn> and instead natural selecion is the judicator of evolution
14:35 < Benn> Evolution is mostly random and sporadic, it doesn't really go anywhere specific
14:35 < Benn> It doesn't make a decision in and of itself
14:35 < inffmus> Benn reading on 'phenotypes' thats to do with natural selection
14:35 < inffmus> yes
14:36 < inffmus> thats what i mean
14:36 < inffmus> i think with simple organisms
14:36 < Benn> Natural selection is more changes in nature that select the survivability of a species based on it's characteristics
14:36 < inffmus> its much more blatant
14:36 < inffmus> that it is kind of 'random'
14:36 < inffmus> as to what survives
14:36 < Benn> Example, food becomes scarce, large animals die first
14:36 < inffmus> and as you advance
14:37 < inffmus> it becomes gradually more adaptable
14:37 < inffmus> on its own
14:37 < inffmus> and how it mutates
14:37 < inffmus> ah
14:37 < inffmus> ok
14:37 < inffmus> yes
14:37 < inffmus> these are the only limits
14:37 < inffmus> against organisms i think
14:38 < inffmus> there must be something with 'nature' to look at then iz
14:38 < Benn> then you have something like 'Develops the ability to detect light'
14:38 < inffmus> yes
14:38 < Benn> which gives you an huge advantage over other living things that can't detect light
14:38 < inffmus> by luck
14:38 < inffmus> i believe
14:39 < inffmus> so it can function within natures limits much better
14:39 < inffmus> so its much better at not dying
14:39 < Benn> Yeah
14:39 < inffmus> but anyways
14:39 < inffmus> back to free will
14:39 < inffmus> i honestly dont know
14:39 < inffmus> if we have or dont have
14:40 < inffmus> if there is free will
14:40 < inffmus> suppose you have 'worlds' A and B with the exact same initial properties
14:40 < inffmus> (A=B initially)
14:40 < inffmus> you can probably say with free will, after initial atleast at some point, A!=B
14:40 < inffmus> but at the same time
14:40 < inffmus> if we consider quantum mechanics
14:41 < inffmus> you can see how there is fundamental randomness
14:41 < inffmus> that may lead to A!=B too
14:41 < inffmus> maybe free will derives from 'randomness'?
14:41 < inffmus> i dont know
14:41 < inffmus> :(
14:44 < Elegrant> inffmus, good thinking
14:44 < inffmus> need to read on determinism
14:44 < Elegrant> randomness is the possibility background radiation of necessity of which statically maintains the fields of pure appearing
14:45 < inffmus> ?
14:45 < Benn> Quantum mechanics is about probability of events and the further from the start you try to 'determine' the harder it becomes because of the increased number of chances of change between what you know and what becomes
14:45 < Elegrant> that is, to be free is to appear against this static, emerging out from it
14:45 < Elegrant> but also to change the field upon which you emerge from
14:45 < inffmus> Benn yeah, maybe it is associated to free will, since it should lead to the A!=B case
14:46 < iz> i think he means "true random"
14:46 < inffmus> Elegrant too much unexplained terminology for me to understand you, im afraid
14:46 < inffmus> and it looks like too much to catch up on to understand what you mean
14:46 < iz> like.. if there is such a thing as randomness
14:47 < Elegrant> inffmus, no bother it was rather word salady
14:47 < iz> then A and B would diverge almost immediately, even without free-will
14:47 < inffmus> iz i think it can be proven mathematically
14:47 < Elegrant> inffmus, basically my theory of quantum space-time is a kind of fuzz, like static on a tv set
14:47 < Elegrant> a kind of Twin Peaks-ish ontology
14:48 < Elegrant> randomness changes channels
14:48 < inffmus> what i dont like what my view of evolution for instance though, is how it can point to nihilism
14:48 < iz> inffmus: proving things mathematically won't prove anything about the truthfulness of the analogy you try to make between the math and reality
14:48 < inffmus> yes i dont know, Elegrant :>
14:48 < aggi> awesome
14:48 < inffmus> iz why not
14:49 < iz> because the math proof just proves the math is correct, not that the anlogy is
14:49 < inffmus> iz math derives from logic
14:49 < Elegrant> Math attath
14:49 < inffmus> iz and logic derives from philo
14:50 < iz> poop derives from food also, but that doesn't mean poop is food
14:50 < Benn> it does if you are a dog
14:50 < iz> heh
14:50 < iz> bad dog!
14:51 < inffmus> iz im saying that maths is used to understand reality
14:51 < Elegrant> or is it more create new realities?
14:51 < inffmus> iz not that it can 'prove reality' or anything
14:51 < inffmus> but that it can explain it very well
14:51 < inffmus> Elegrant hm?
14:51 < iz> the truth is more like.. maths is used on simplified models we make of reality to try to understand reality
14:52 < inffmus> iz yes
14:52 < inffmus> iz and its been working well for a very long time :<
14:52 < inffmus> anyways, i am too tired now to thinking of your point iz
14:52 < iz> that model to reality relationship is what i meant before by "analogy"
14:52 < inffmus> but its a nice thing to think about yeah
14:52 < iz> i'm still thinking about the evolution has free will thing
14:52 < iz> i went to make coffee and i've still been thinking about it in the background :D

You can't simply say 'we now know the object where as before we simply didn't have the information, or correct formula/algorithm', this lack of information was already inscribed into the object, in a way a kind of 'pre-mathematical description' ontology which differs from the mathematical ontology. Maths changed reality is what i'm saying, and
14:55 < Elegrant> routinely does so with new advancements in it
14:55 < Benn> it's just a word to describe a whole host of processes
14:55 < Elegrant> just as science does, and theology etc.
14:56 < Elegrant> as our thinking changes, so does our reality to meet it
14:57 < Elegrant> but not necessarily 'match'. Asymmetrical relation between subject and symbolic ground
14:58 < Benn> How can you tell the difference between a greater understanding of reality and a reality that changes to meet your expectations of reality
14:59 < Elegrant> we are in a post-Kantian, Hegelian era of thought
14:59 < Elegrant> this means a post-Kantian, maybe pseudo-Hegelian reality
15:00 < Elegrant> Benn, but it doesn't meet expectations of reality
15:01 < Elegrant> there are fits and errors all the time
15:01 < Elegrant> and reality is not always so 'stable'
15:01 < Benn> Maybe
15:01 < Benn> maybe it is our perception that isn't so stable
15:01 < Elegrant> this is still a kind of post-Kantian reality tho
15:01 < Benn> I don't really know what that means
15:02 < Elegrant> Benn, well that's what I'm saying, we don't have the information for what ever reason, whether that's about a stable perception or what, I don't know, its about a singularly subjective lack, the subject lacks a piece of information etc.
15:03 -!- Borkr [~Borkr@mail.seaonics.com] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
15:03 < Elegrant> and that is why the object is not known, the lack of being an informed subject
15:03 < Benn> mmm
15:03 < Elegrant> or at least that's the Kantian way of thinking about it
15:03 < Benn> I see
15:05 < Elegrant> Hegel would say yes, the object is not known and the subject did not have the necessary information to know it, but the lack of knowledge is inscribed or immanent in the object itself, and that our finding out more about an object is itself a re-inscription process
15:07 < Elegrant> Benn, the lack in the subject's approach to object is inscribed in object as such
15:09 < Elegrant> that is, the field out from which object is located, differentiable etc. is itself structured in such a way around a Real of gaps in subjectivity
15:09 < kavanaugh> Elegrant: stfu
15:10 < Elegrant> but the object is not subject, nor is it however fully object
15:11 < Elegrant> kavanaugh, ?
15:11 < kavanaugh> stfu
15:13 < Elegrant> https://youtu.be/XniIQaL1b8k
15:14 < Benn> is not everything a subject though?
15:14 < Elegrant> Benn, not a subject-as-such
15:14 < Elegrant> ie. a subject in itself, self-reflexive subject
15:14 < Benn> object-subject duality to everything depending on your relationship to the situation
15:15 < kavanaugh> lol.
15:16 < Elegrant> Benn, well yes, if there is a 'you' there, there is a subject
15:18 < Elegrant> but I think this ambiguity of subject is actually a key feature of subjectivity
15:20 < Elegrant> that is to say this being able to mistake an object for being a subject, ie. maybe the scenery is arranged in such a miraculous way that it all aligns from your perspective into something resembling a free subject, a consistently One subject-as-such, but is really just a perspectival illusion caused by mundane objective substances and a parallactic gap
15:21 < Elegrant> now in me saying that I still think we are free, but precisely as this 'gap'
15:24 < Elegrant> that is to say the split of subject-object which is redoubled as a structural feature of subject, is perhaps one area we might find something 'vital' to at least the effective experience of freedom

15:43 < pug> "To the Greeks 'kepticism' meant inquiry, and a skeptic was an inquirer. The skeptics so named themselves because the essence of their position was not doubt or denial or disbelief, but continual inquiry. They did not believe in the reality of a god, for example, but neither did they deny it. Nor did they even say that nobody could ever know for certain one way or the other, as agnostics do. Skeptics said instead, 'I personally do not know at the moment

16:30 < lubicorn> it was all lies
16:30 < lubicorn> i had setbacks because of it
16:31 < lubicorn> instead im being more "selfish", and my life is getting better
16:31 < lubicorn> Life because easier this way
16:31 < lubicorn> Why are we taught to be good?
16:31 < lubicorn> Maybe it's only for the privileged?

16:33 < stefycute> Hey
16:33 < watom> there are benefits

16:33 < watom> what
16:33 < stefycute> I dont know how to be selfish
16:33 < watom> you said
16:33 < watom> that giving too much away
16:33 < watom> hurted you
16:33 < lubicorn> yes
16:33 < watom> i'm saying that you need just to belance
16:33 < lubicorn> ok
16:33 < arryana> if you want to be selfish, be selfish.  if you want to be 'good', be 'good'.
16:34 < watom> you can be good but still not
16:34 < arryana> you don
16:34 < watom> hurt yourself
16:34 < lubicorn> But then why give at all, since the benefits are very low?
16:34 < arryana> t really need to generalize or justify it
16:34 < watom> where that
16:34 < lubicorn> or the "benefits" might just be in our minds
16:34 < watom> low benefits went from?
16:34 < watom> is kinda unrelated
16:34 < stefycute> Im just being myself and trying to better for someone else thats all not easy
16:34 < watom> you can have material benefits
16:34 < lubicorn> lets say giving the smallest thing hurts me..
16:34 < lubicorn> So I shouldnt give at all then
16:35 < watom> i dont know
16:35 < watom> hurts you
16:35 < watom> being rational
16:35 < watom> or just random
16:35 < arryana> i think you're looking for a free pass to act however you want.
16:35 < watom> if something hurt you. you should try to avoid
16:35 < watom> if is not necessary lubicorn
16:35 < watom> that's not related to being good
16:35 < watom> is just about you doing good choices
16:35 < lubicorn> arryana: i can do that anyways.. i just want to discuss it. Im already being more selfish atm
16:35 < stefycute> Sometimes you just give to see people smile nothing more to it
16:36 < arryana> i work for two extraordinarily generous people.

16:36 < lubicorn> Maybe its a part of life to realize the truth on your own
16:36 < arryana> what is that worth?
16:36 < watom> and when you can avoid
16:36 < watom> i'm selfish i do something bad and i have control on it
16:36 < watom> if you don't do something since will hurt you
16:37 < watom> is not selfish.
16:37 < watom> is just rational
16:37 < arryana> if i were selfish, they would have no interest in improving my life
16:37 < watom> lubicorn being good is not painfull.
16:37 < watom> you need to evaluete choices better
16:37 < watom> it's not related to being good
16:37 < watom> is just you
16:37 < lubicorn> "being good" isnt the same as giving in some way
16:37 < arryana> and in turn, we all live in a happy place where we can trust one another to give all we have.

18:13 < stefycute> How can u defend those compassionate dudes?
18:14 < stefycute> If u can provd to me god doesnt exist then maybe i can agree with u.
18:15 < aggi> otherwise everyone on this channel had to call stefycute as "your holyness"
18:15 < stefycute> thank you
18:15 < stefycute> But im not holy

18:16 < stefycute> eh?
18:16 < stefycute> i dont get it
18:17 < stefycute> im not compassionate
18:17 < stefycute> I dont know where you get this stuff
18:17 < oy> arryana: you see, this is not a total condemnation of character, you're being very uncharitable. What it means is that ceteris paribus a person who is not committed to beliefs which there are no evidence for is more intellectually honest than someone who is.
18:18 < oy> Is that better?
18:18 < arryana> bah.  i think what you believe is nonsense and i believe differently.  call me any name you like to make yourself feel better.

18:20 < arryana> so we're done discussing it.

18:24 < stefycute> Then to not over populate earth with these animals the carniverous was created
18:24 < aggi> evolution is not causal
18:24 < aggi> but a dynamic system
18:25 < stefycute> Now the humans were created totake care of earth and its beings but with lack of knowledge they over populated earth

19:00 < pug> and i don't know that rational thinking is necessarily the *best* thinking.
19:01 < pug> maybe consider keeping your opinions about who's welcome here to yourself, oy...
19:02 < oy> I don't understand. There is no alternative. Rational thinking cannot be suspended. Doing so is self-deception insofar that a person also claims to be committed to truth.
19:02 -!- tavish_ [~tavish@unaffiliated/tavish] has quit [Client Quit]
19:03 < oy> hence, "intellectually dishonest"
19:03 < oy> because it entails self-deception
19:03 < pug> i'm a skeptic so i don't see truth as the target philosophically speaking... also, your view only follows if something can only be true or false and not both.
19:04 < oy> That is a fair assumption. LoL
19:04 < pug> i would argue this only holds for a subset of cases -- namely those which are truth-functiona.
19:04 < arryana> i read some of the things you posted earlier, pug, they were very thought-inspiring
19:04 < arryana> thanks for the link
19:04 < pug> truth-functional*
19:04 < pug> arryana: my pleasure.
19:04 < oy> Everything is truth-functional. That which isn't is merely vague and ambiguous, ergo, meaningless to varying degree.
19:05 < pug> I enjoy well written pieces diving into skepticism. they're rare enough that it's a joy to find one.
19:05 < pug> oy: you're allowed to think that and argue for it but do so without alienating other users.
19:05 < arryana> the whole concept of skepticism is fascinating.  it's an escape from 'yes' and 'no' into 'what if' and 'maybe'
19:06 -!- ixxie [~ixxie@82-181-162-226.bb.dnainternet.fi] has quit [Quit: Lost terminal]
19:06 < arryana> so many things are true or not true only conditionally that skepticism makes a great deal of sense.
19:06 < arryana> 'water is wet'... but not when it's ice, et
19:06 < pug> Indeed there are a variety of skeptical positions. I'm close to a classical or philosophical skeptic.
19:06 < arryana> etc
19:06 < arryana> though that's a vast oversimplification
19:07 < oy> There are no true contradictions in reality.
19:07  * arryana nods
19:07 < pug> there is no reality without the constraints of the concept which is itself an artifact of human langauge.
19:07 < oy> There is no barber who both shaves himself and doesn't shave himself. Such things don't exist.
19:08 < pug> so i'll agree to truth-functionality for any case in language that necessarily has a binary truth value...
19:09 < pug> but anything outside of such a structure can be multi-valued in a few different ways.
19:09 < oy> pug: But they do. You would have to give an example of a meaningful statement of fact which isn't binary.

19:12 < Thanatological> oy, are conflicts of mandates possible?
19:13 < oy> Thanatological: you'd have to be more specific
19:13 < Thanatological> oy, can two laws conflict?
19:14 < oy> Oh, like clashing principles. Surely. Don't see this as an example of a true contradiction.
19:14 < oy> A principle, such as a moral one, is NOT a statement of fact.
19:15 < Thanatological> Well, I'm purposefully not talking about morality, but legality; if two laws conflict, we don't want everything to be legal, do we?
19:16 < arryana> heya aloo
19:17 < oy> 1. Thou shalt not under any circumstances kill. 2. Thou must use whatever means available to prevent killing. 1 contradicts 2 in certain scenarios, and vice versa. Same thing with laws I guess. Uhm
19:17 < aloo_shu> hello hello
19:18 < pug> arryana: some part of me identifies with Suber's take on skepticism... another part of me is something more negative and disinterested in convoluted bullshit. :P
19:18 < oy> But what such a contradiction shows is just that 1 and 2 are not detailed enough
19:18 < arryana> haha
19:18 < pug> maybe like an anti-skeptic or something. :)
19:18 < aloo_shu> exactly, oy
19:18 < arryana> i'm a simple creature myself, i quite understand the revulsion of convoluted bullshit.
19:19 < lubicorn> Do you guys use facebook?
19:19 < oy> No pug it means you are a true skeptic, skeptical of skepticism itself.
19:19 < oy> lubicorn: nah
19:20 < pug> maybe. i'm not a big fan of truth. i've had more trouble with it than most things and find pursuing it to lack much reward for me.
19:20 < pug> seems like most truth crusaders i know are people i'm bothered by.
19:20 < arryana> i find truth to be too often conditional
19:20 < arryana> 'did you take the cookie' is a yes or no question i can get behind.
19:20 < aloo_shu> under any circumstances , whatever means , are both broad generalisations. and then again, you have a derivate of the paradoxon of tolerance there, oy
19:21 < arryana> once someone starts arguing 'what do you mean by 'took' and 'the cookie'...' i'm out of the discussion
19:21 < pug> answers are often more annoying to me than if someone concedes to simply asking more questions.
19:21 < arryana> because... really/
19:22 < pug> I'll find out *just how* binary this universe is after i die.
19:22 < arryana> hahah
19:22 < arryana> pragmatic
19:22 < pug> until then, i'll probably study more presocratics and organize philosophy education programs.
19:22  * arryana nods
19:22 < aloo_shu> irc, home of the objective annoyance :)
19:23 < Thanatological> Well, I'm also a moral realist. The grounds of morality follow from the nature of personhood; Hume was wrong. :D
19:26 < aggi> what is the nature of personhood?
19:26 < oy> As far as I'm concerned, truth accepted in a pragmatist sense,  is equivalent to truth accepted in other senses. It makes no difference. We cannot go below the level of truth and binary thinking. No human being actually thinks in paraconsistent logic, that's not how our brains operate.

21:33 < cloudowind> good morning lovers of wisdom
21:34 < cloudowind> so what happened to our yesterdays conversation
21:35 < cloudowind> arts music space and time
21:35 < cloudowind> then we jumped to dumb german philosophers:)
21:35 < aggi> knigge
21:35 < aggi> and self-esteem
21:36 < cloudowind> what about arts?
21:36 < cloudowind> one said here artists also wants to create an impact
21:36 < cloudowind> it is not yet what really belongs to arts
21:37 < aggi> isn't arts just an excuse for lack of discipline?
21:37 < cloudowind> clear on me , because this fellow says ' arts are to decorate space and music is to decorate the time
21:37 < cloudowind> hehe
21:37 < cloudowind> so you brought to your mind the improvised arts
21:43 < cloudowind> well, if you ask my own opinion

21:43 < cloudowind> everything is an art

21:43 < cloudowind> it is like the whole creation alligned for to create the ultimate art
21:43 < cloudowind> the art of being hehe
21:44 < cloudowind> it is beautiful though ...
21:44 < cloudowind> if it is not , what else will be?
21:44 < cloudowind> *alligned/gathered
21:45 < cloudowind> imagine our planet on this infinity system of planets and stars

21:49 < cloudowind> yet , aristotle believes arts got to the with perception , and have great ties with it , as we got closed to this yesterday , and he was saying something about the artists common charecterists about him how he can go beyond the common perception
21:50 < cloudowind> and being able to to synthesis , and yet how he , hold on , i got this passage better to see his own sentences
21:51 -!- aloo_shu [~atomic@195.135.251.213] has quit [Quit: 't has been a pleasure]
21:51 < cloudowind> "all men suppose what is called Wisdom to deal with the first causes and the principles of things; so that, as has been said before, the man of experience is thought to be
21:51 < cloudowind> wiser than the possessors of any sense-perception whatever, the artist wiser than the men of experience, the master-worker than the mechanic, and the theoretical kinds of knowledge to be more of the nature of Wisdom than the productive.
21:51 < cloudowind> Clearly then Wisdom is knowledge about certain principles and causes."Aristotle T.F.P
21:52 < cloudowind> this part  here clearly shows how he approaches
21:52 < cloudowind> " Again, we do not regard any of the senses as Wisdom; yet surely these give the most authoritative knowledge of particulars. But they do not tell us the 'why' of anything-e.g. why fire is hot; they only say that it is hot
21:52 < cloudowind> At first he who invented any art whatever that went beyond the common perceptions of man was naturally admired by men, not only because there was something useful in the inventions, but because he was thought wise and superior to the rest
21:52 < cloudowind> But as more arts were invented, and some were directed to the necessities of life, others to recreation, the inventors of the latter were naturally always regarded as wiser than the inventors of the former, because their branches of knowledge did not aim at utility. Hence when all such inventions were already established, the sciences which do not aim at giving pleasure or at the necessities of life were discovered,
21:52 < cloudowind> and first in the places where men first began to have leisure. This is why the mathematical arts were founded in Egypt; for there the priestly caste was allowed to be at leisure." Aristotle
21:53 < cloudowind> so how he sees the arts and artists you reckon?

22:11 < aggi> *could be
22:11 < cloudowind> can Leisure also be the limiting force ?
22:12 < aggi> archimedes constructed intruiging war machinery
22:12 < cloudowind> i mean being lack of formal necessities ? imagine a king doesn't even have to move to live:)
22:12 < cloudowind> and consider the suicide ratios of
22:13 < cloudowind> high income societies
22:13 < aggi> which is?
22:14 < aggi> on average low income population in germany, their live-expectency is reduced by 20 years, round about

22:51 < ApocalypseCow> i may have to back up off it for a few
22:51 < pug> Need to finish vetting my ancient sources for an essay before I can relax for the night.
22:52 < pug> Zero motivation.

22:54 < ApocalypseCow> hah.
22:54 < ApocalypseCow> i still have data to collate from ##politics-uncensored
22:54 < ApocalypseCow> not even doing it today
22:54 < ApocalypseCow> so many reports due

22:55 < ApocalypseCow> prototype uh..6?  I think.  came out perfect.
22:55 < pug> I read a biography of Hunter S. where he accounted for a time in college when he typed out Fitzgerald's work because he liked the rhythms so much.
22:55 < pug> I really like that sort of thing.

22:55 < sj0rz> he was an extraordinary man
22:56 < ApocalypseCow> such tolerance
22:56 < ApocalypseCow> "ignore this terrible drug." has worked for me in the past.  true story.
22:58 < sj0rz> i'm always amazed when people can consume those amounts of drugs and stay social and active in life
22:58 < pug> I always laugh at the politics alternative channels. Modulus normally runs a pretty good shop in my experience, but I guess i don't hang out in many of the pol channels because of all the preaching.
22:58 < sj0rz> whenever i did it became the only thing i did
22:59 < ApocalypseCow> pug, you should come over and check it out

23:01 < pug> everyone should have a place to do their thing on here as long as the staffers aren't having a fit over anything. i don't mind the network diversity so long as people respect the limits of each particular channel community.
23:01 < ApocalypseCow> Freenode has TOS
23:01 < ApocalypseCow> and they need to be enforced to prevent waste of resources.
23:02 < pug> learning to /ignore and /part can be a sort of artform.
23:02 < ApocalypseCow> this costs money, of which they get little
23:02 < pug> lol
23:03 < pug> yeah, it's been interesting to see the freenode terms and standards change over the years.

23:40 < tttb> how is it that I loved The Matrix but I find the discussion that we're in a computer simulation childish and useless?

23:42 < tttb> sj0rz, i was 8 when matrix came out so maybe
23:42 < pug> aloo_shu: I don't know of any good resources for history on the network outside of what google turns up. Most of my experience comes from waves of use through gaming, learning to code and project organizing. Back in the day there were more gaming channels, especially for modding Quake, Half-Life and Unreal Tournament.
23:42 < tttb> did the scene where neo's mouth gets covered in skin disgust/scare anyone else here?
23:43 < pug> a lot has changed since then though... so i guess what i remember depends on what you're interested in, aloo_shu. :)
23:43 < sj0rz> i loved the quake3 scene
23:43 < pug> I was a big fan. Still am, really... I just don't play any more. :)
23:43 < pug> Good memories though.
23:44 < pug> I got really into Rocket Arena
23:44 < pug> and the guys who built the map packs were really open about testing with active community members.
23:44 < pug> I loved that.
23:44 < sj0rz> yeah
23:44 < pug> I used to LAN with the guy who developed most of their best shaders.

23:45 < sj0rz> back when dragging around crt monitors was a thing

23:50 < aloo_shu> despite ludopathic traits
23:51 < aloo_shu> but I love to listen
23:52 < sj0rz> if only we could master impulse control we'd be a different species
23:53 < pug> aloo_shu: early freenode was a group of irc users and developers who were looking to expand their own network out of a series of channels on another older network. they wanted something like a FOSS, project-oriented network space the way I remember it... something a little more ambitious than what most of the other networks were working with. I hopped in early to with a group looking to develop Quake and Unreal mods and maps. Mostly PlanetQuake folks.
23:54 < pug> the firsh shift I recognized was when it went from being a growing network to a serious undertaking with a mature staff and website... and a userbase that was outgrowing the hardware capacity...
23:55 < pug> it seems like most of freenode's life has been one of managing a rather sizable staff to help accommodate the growth and needs of the community against the hard reality of little to no overhead funding.
23:58 < pug> I'd say the first time I noticed things changing was something like nine years ago then it started getting support and funding from a few regular FOSS projects and the nature of the undertaking became a branch of another larger series of projects... probably around late 2014.
23:59 < pug> Since then freenode has been working on taking itself way more seriously and building up a stronger sense of direction for the network overall.
