00:00 < hanzp> ugh pls dont
00:00 < sj0rz> i prefer that over only discussing academically certified opinions personally
00:00 < sj0rz> but that might be just me
00:00 < bosspotato> academically certified opinions have to be justified in order to be given an importance in the first place
00:00 < bosspotato> if it can be shown that they are justified then fine
00:00 < bosspotato> but that work has to be done before taking them seriously
00:00 < pug> i'd prefer you discuss the details of the differences in your posiitons.
00:01 < hanzp> ^^
00:01 < sj0rz> i always only do that
00:01 < sj0rz> to the best of my ability
00:01 < pug> how does that involve talking shit?
00:01 < sj0rz> when did i talk shit?
00:01 < bosspotato> wow ad hominems
00:02 < sj0rz> you must confuse me for someone else
00:02 -!- erasmus [~erasmus@unaffiliated/erasmus] has quit [Quit: Fahrvergn√ºgen!]
00:02 < pug> alright... maybe you haven't? i guess i misread all the consternation and dismissiveness.
00:02 < sj0rz> must be, i wasn't even around for the nerdfiles discussion
00:02 < sj0rz> in fact i've never even seen the nick
00:03 < pug> then i apologize. must've been mostly bosspotato.
00:03 < bosspotato> for what it's worth me trying to understand what nerdfiles was saying and initiating a serious discussion with him was a sincere attempt
00:03 < bosspotato> at least at the beginning
00:03 -!- kome [~mah@2a02:ab88:2444:de80:900b:1cfe:b72b:a29f] has quit [Quit: bye]
00:03 < bosspotato> I must admit I tend to lose my calm when I am faced with dogmatic nonsense
00:03 < bosspotato> such as "hey I cited marx and linked to an article"
00:04 < pug> bosspotato: i noticed your effort. i can acknowledge that. :)
00:04 < bosspotato> or posting the same passage 4 times instead of actually replying to my questions
00:04 < pug> i get fussed about the fallout after things break into hostility more than anything, to be honest.
00:04 < pug> contention is fine thouhg.
00:04 < pug> it's a good path towards learning if it's healthy.
00:05 < bosspotato> I am very healthy thanks
00:05 < sj0rz> i agree
00:05 < pug> like i said... i have trouble imagining people are less than full of shit.
00:05 < pug> so i don't trust much of anything.
00:05 < pug> :)
00:05 < sj0rz> well then i'd call that arrogance
00:05 < pug> maybe. i call it skepticism
00:05 < pug> maybe i'm arrogant.
00:05 < pug> you must know me better than i know myself, sj0rz
00:05 < Jana-Mana> maybe not, you are
00:05 < bosspotato> not sure to what you are referring
00:06 < pug> i'm arrogantly skeptical. lol. i guess.
00:06 < pug> whatever, i get to be that then i suppose.
00:06 < bosspotato> sigh
00:07 < sj0rz> i'm also fairly arrogant
00:07 -!- thunderscore [~thunder@gateway/vpn/privateinternetaccess/thunderscore] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
00:07 < pug> i'm a confused person. i get pissed off by finger pointing because it reads like projecting to me. maybe that's arrogant. :) maybe we're all arrogant for variously justified reasons.
00:07 < pug> no idea. i just call it like i see it the way y'all say you do.
00:08 < bosspotato> definition of "finger pointing" required
00:08 < bosspotato> it feels a lil' bit like it's a synonym for "questioning"
00:08 < bosspotato> but it must be something else
00:08 < pug> when you use your finger to point at something and make claims about it. in this case i mean laying claim to special knowledge of other users or positions.
00:09 < bosspotato> could you provide an example
00:09 < bosspotato> as far as I'm aware I never laid claim to special knowledge
00:10 < pug> [ 14:55:46 ] [ bosspotato ] taunting banned people? more like expressing my joy that this troll got banned at last
00:10 < bosspotato> and what's wrong with that?
00:11 < pug> i can pull the rest of the log so we can see all the times you were dismissive or accusatory
00:11 < pug> would that help clarify?
00:11 < bosspotato> I've spent enough time reading his logs to come to the conclusion that he's trolling and not much else
00:11 < bosspotato> then again that's my opinion, sure
00:11 < aloo_shu> I don't know what's wrong with that, but we could talk about playing dumb instead
00:12 < bosspotato> but my overall life attitude is that something that I can't understand and that can't be clarified by someone who supposedly understands it is in fact meaningless
00:12 < bosspotato> that's excessively arrogant I suppose
00:12 < mrdata> "finger pointing" is blame-routing
00:13 < mrdata> an example being, blaming obama for the russia scandal
00:14 < mrdata> when pointing your finger, have a look at the three fingers pointing back at you
00:14 < aloo_shu> 'is meaningless' is an attempt at an objective statement. 'not meaningful to me' would avoid it, but then if you keep on arguing about the meaninglessness of meaningless things, much credibility isn't left
00:14 < oy> https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf page 11. for some interesting statistics, otherwise bjs.gov has all the raw data that demonstrates without a shadow of a doubt that there is no institutional racism within law enforcement, enjoy
00:14 < pug> i'm done putting up a fight so y'all can conclude as you wish... i just have to keep tabs on the way people treat each other in here and i'm especially displeased by putdowns, ESPECIALLY when unaccompanied by clarification.
00:14 -!- tmg [~tmg@unaffiliated/tmg] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
00:15 < bosspotato> I'm working with the hypothesis that if it's meaningless to me and that it can't be explained to me then it's meaningless, yes
00:15 < sj0rz> yes
00:15 < sj0rz> and you should
00:15 < sj0rz> otherwise you have no grounding
00:15 < sj0rz> and anything goes
00:15 < bosspotato> yep
00:16 < bosspotato> objectivity is just the sum of all subjectivities
00:16 < aggi> what is the topic people?
00:16 < aloo_shu> bosspotato: so you are working with the hypothesis that your categories are universal
00:16 < bosspotato> and there isn't much reason for subjectivities to be different in a rational context
00:16 < bosspotato> yes
00:16 < bosspotato> in fact there is strictly no reason at all
00:17 < aloo_shu> good to be always right, bad for having a convo
00:17 < oy> I'm supremely non-arrogant, like I don't think there is a humbler person out there.
00:17 < bosspotato> this is not being always right
00:17 < sj0rz> not at all
00:17 < sj0rz> if someone explains to you why you are wrong
00:17 < sj0rz> you are not right
00:17 < bosspotato> this is just intellectual hygiene
00:17 < sj0rz> but if someone is unable to explain why you are wrong
00:17 < sj0rz> go ahead and keep believing you were right
00:17 < bosspotato> ^
00:18 < bosspotato> there is no reason at all for everyone not to have the exact same criteria for truth
00:18 < bosspotato> in rational matters at least
00:19 < sj0rz> oy haha did you see trump stating that?
00:19 < sj0rz> it was magnificent
00:19 < aloo_shu> nothing wrong with going on believing, but stating it as an objective truth? why should anybody follow every rhetorical challenge to prove or disprove now this, now that?
00:19 < bosspotato> because no honest conversation is possible without that?
00:19 < sj0rz> indeed
00:19 < mrdata> bosspotato, are you going to dictate those criteria?
00:19 < oy> and we can't dispense with truth neither, like some think, it's such a fundamental notion
00:19 < bosspotato> fortunately not
00:19 < bosspotato> they're pretty widespread
00:19 < bosspotato> outside of philosophy departments at least
00:20 < sj0rz> i do not believe two contradictory statements can both be right, so when i disagree with someone
00:20 < aggi> oy, can you tell me what is being discussed? not that i am willing to contribute, but what is the topic?
00:20 < sj0rz> i want to find out which one is right, and if i was wrong then that's perfectly fine
00:20 < bosspotato> the law of excluded middle is pretty great yes
00:20 < sj0rz> but i just want to resolve it to get to the truth
00:20 < mrdata> reported speech is all suspect
00:20 < oy> aggi: I see no reason why I should be a better judge of what the topic s, than you, you have eyes, you can read no?
00:21 < aloo_shu> why would no honest convo be possible by just waiting until others state their point, and doing one's work to understand it, instead of basing a convo on constant quick-paced prompting?
00:21 < bosspotato> that is what is called a strawman
00:21 < sj0rz> that's an entirely different argument
00:21 < Thanatological> Don't ... stop ... believing ... hold on to that feeeeeeeeling ...
00:21 < sj0rz> now you're saying slow conversation is better than fast conversation
00:21 < sj0rz> how does that relate to what you were saying earlier
00:21 < bosspotato> I would like to remind you that nerd's point was entirely stated
00:22 < bosspotato> then I proceeded to ask
00:22 < bosspotato> "that's a pretty far-fetched argument you've got there, why is that"
00:22 < bosspotato> and I got served with gibberish
00:22 < sj0rz> i had a similar experience with someone else recently
00:22 < sj0rz> i tried to get them to prove me wrong
00:22 < sj0rz> but they wouldn't
00:22 < oy> aggi: :) my point is, it's what it s, kinda fuzzy; old drama, standards of rationality, musings and the like
00:22 < sj0rz> so then i conclude that i was not wrong
00:23 < bosspotato> sounds about right
00:23 < tttb> do you think when AI becomes sentient they will get confused why humans kept emailing things to themselves?
00:23 -!- KindOne [kindone@freenode/father-christmas/kindone] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
00:23 < sj0rz> lol tttb
00:23 < bosspotato> the point is extremely simple and has nothing to do with the pace of the conversation
00:24 < bosspotato> if you can't explain your point to EVERYONE else involved then your point tends to be a little suspect
00:24 < aggi> who's point? what expolanation? about what?
00:24 < bosspotato> scroll up
00:24 < aggi> i did bosspotato
00:25 < bosspotato> we're discussing basic rational methodology
00:25 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: I am making the case for comprehensive convo style vs. cross-examination style, speed can be an indicator there but I wouldn't see it as the root cause
00:25 -!- cariveri [~tell@x4db3c911.dyn.telefonica.de] has quit [Quit: leaving]
00:25 < oy> expolanation is that word in Dr. Johnson's dictionary ?
00:25 < aggi> typo
00:25 < sj0rz> aloo_shu oh earlier it seemed that you were making the argument that one shouldn't assume that their categories of truth are universal
00:26 -!- KindTwo is now known as KindOne
00:26 < bosspotato> the unfortunate fact is that there is no such thing as a category of truth
00:26 < sj0rz> sorry, you said categories are universal
00:26 < bosspotato> hmm?
00:26 < sj0rz> aloo_shu did
00:27 < bosspotato> oh yeah sorry
00:27 < sj0rz> aloo_shu never said "categories of truth" i repeated that incorrectly
00:27 < bosspotato> right
00:27 < aggi> either necessary and sufficient arguments are supplied, with evidence, or they are not
00:27 < bosspotato> not sure who talked about cross-examination style either
00:27 < bosspotato> the point here is that for a conversation to exist and make sense everyone needs to be on the same page
00:27 < sj0rz> the one where truth has value preferrably
00:27 < sj0rz> :P
00:27 < bosspotato> :P
00:28 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: did I not characterise that as my position, saying 'I am making the case', instead of saying something like 'cross-examination is'?
00:28 < theBlah> hey all :) are we having fun
00:28 < aloo_shu> where is my claim to objective universality?
00:29 < theBlah> oop, are we in the middle of a thing
00:29 < sj0rz> aloo_shu that is not a meaningful distinction to me
00:29 < aggi> abstract all-everythingness as qualifier of truth
00:29 < aggi> where is captain metaphysics when he is needed?
00:29 < sj0rz> aloo_shu whenever someone says that something is a certain way, it's implicit to me that that's their position
00:29 < bosspotato> probably busy reading Hegel
00:29 < theBlah> Captain Metaphysics! i like it
00:29 < sj0rz> explicitly specifying that does not add anything for me
00:30 < aloo_shu> then on that line, we're unlikely to make headway, sj0rz (response to further up)
00:30 < sj0rz> are you saying that your position is not necessarily what you think to be the truth?
00:30 < sj0rz> to me it's implicit that your position is what you believe to be the truth
00:31 < sj0rz> if that's not the case i indeed don't see how we could have a meaningful conversation
00:31 < theBlah> doesn't "your position" also include that sort'a deal? implicitly?
00:31 < sj0rz> i think so yeah
00:32 < sj0rz> but aloo_shu seems to make a distinction there somehow
00:32 < bosspotato> the distinction often made is that truth is relative to your perception
00:32 < bosspotato> from there we conclude that two people can believe opposite things and somehow both be right
00:32 < aggi> perception of evidence
00:32 < bosspotato> which is a pretty comical argument
00:32 < sj0rz> yeah, so then truth has no value
00:32 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: personally, I do practice and like that way of communication, too, like just throwing 'my' truth there with the understanding that everyone is welcome to challenge it, but that needs a bit of trust between participants and can lead to rather shitty group dynamics among irc strangers. it doesn't make a good default
00:32 < sj0rz> so nothing matters, and any discussion can decay into that
00:33 < sj0rz> ah you see i don't think there is such a thing as "my" truth
00:33 < sj0rz> i think there is my view of the truth
00:33 < sj0rz> and there is the truth
00:33 < sj0rz> those certainly differ
00:33 < sj0rz> but i don't see how the notion of "my" truth is meaningful in any way
00:33 < sj0rz> other than to specify my view of the truth
00:34 < aggi> and your feelings, ofc
00:34 < aloo_shu> it is a naming convention, of course truth does not really make sense in plural
00:34 < sj0rz> well if it doesn't make sense i'd say it's a bad convention
00:35 < aloo_shu> convention implies that participants convene on a definition, but since you haven't made sure I convene withyour definitions, don't tae me up on it
00:36 < sj0rz> anyways i'm open to feedback to my style of communication
00:36 < sj0rz> yeah i refuse to define truth in every conversation
00:36 < sj0rz> it leads to the decay of a discussion
00:36 < sj0rz> i guess that's stubborn
00:37 < aloo_shu> well, re-phrase: does trueth practically exist at all, or is all that ever can be said about it, views of truth?
00:37 < sj0rz> it does exist
00:37 < sj0rz> i can hold the view that i will not fall down if i just out the window
00:37 < sj0rz> but reality exists and it will show me that i will actually fall down
00:37 < sj0rz> *jump
00:37 < oy> As I see it, truth is defined in a convention-correspondence kind of  way. A rough sketch of this is : some language L and some grammar are devised to represent a state of affairs so that a convention specifies when a certain linguistic formula represents a state of affairs. We can take a very simple example of a language, it has only two words {tiger, not-tiger} An utterance "tiger" is true in this linguistic setting
00:37 < oy> whenever a tiger is observable, and vice versa.
00:38 < sj0rz> so the truth of the matter is that i will fall down if i jump out the window
00:38 < sj0rz> regardless of what my view on this matter is
00:38 < sj0rz> so to me it's trivial that truth actually exists
00:39 < Jana-Mana> aggi are you fish?
00:39 < aggi> is there any evidence at all supplied for everyone to perceive willing to? is the thesis valid, in the sense of Karl Popper, that it can be considered scientific and rejected
00:39 < sj0rz> furthermore, i can honestly not fathom how someone would arrive at the conclusion that there is no truth more true than any given subjective view
00:39 < aggi> Jana-Mana: no, but human species evolved from fish, and is still a related to fish
00:39 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: there would be people (not me) to challenge gravity
00:40 < sj0rz> yes, because their views differ from the truth
00:40 < sj0rz> saying that there is a truth out there doesn't mean that everyone's view of the truth is the correct one
00:40 < Jana-Mana> I mean in the horoscoop
00:40 < Jana-Mana> fish
00:41 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: so that view, of what is it the view, if it isn't the view of the truth?
00:41 < sj0rz> it is an incorrect view of the truth
00:41 < aloo_shu> how do you find out?
00:42 < sj0rz> by testing it or by discussing it with others
00:42 < sj0rz> if someone can trivially explain to you why you are wrong
00:42 < sj0rz> you find out it's incorrect
00:42 < sj0rz> which is the value of debate we were getting at earlier
00:42 < aggi> Jana-Mana: i do not read horoscope
00:43 < aloo_shu> that works well with logical edifices, but not with jumping out of windows
00:43 < sj0rz> indeed, in those cases you can just try it
00:43 < sj0rz> that seems even more trivial
00:43 < aggi> but instead i owe some book about tropical fish to keep as pet in tanks
00:43 < Jana-Mana> I read often
00:43 < sj0rz> you can drop an object and see that your view that there is no gravity is an incorrect one
00:43 < sj0rz> you are confronted with this reality all the time
00:43 < sj0rz> i don't understand how you could argue that it's not there
00:44 < aloo_shu> ooof, you could read up eastern philosophy on mind over matter..
00:44 < sj0rz> what would that show me?
00:45 < aloo_shu> that the fact you see an object drop still is no proof to people who otherwise show signs of intelligence
00:45 < sj0rz> they can see it for themselves as well
00:45 < sj0rz> i really don't get what we are discussing here
00:45 < sj0rz> are we now discussing if gravity is real?
00:45 < aggi> the gravitational constant is a highly questionable concept
00:46 < shekib82> Hello
00:46 < aloo_shu> no, not discussing it just saying people do
00:46 < sj0rz> the concept of truth does not hinge on gravity being one way or another
00:46 < aggi> but, next to all the fake arguments of yours, gravitation exists
00:46 < astroo-> hello
00:46 -!- Rawriful [~orin@host86-163-222-75.range86-163.btcentralplus.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
00:46 < aloo_shu> to be more precise, they do not say gravity is unreal
00:46 < shekib82> what's up? what is being discussed?
00:46 < aloo_shu>  they would say it is the expression of other forces even more real
00:47 < aggi> shekib82: it is a persiflage of sophism what is presented around #philsophy
00:47 -!- uZiel [~ircuser@gateway/tor-sasl/uziel] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
00:48 < sj0rz> i don't understand it at all
00:48 < sj0rz> aloo_shu so let me turn it around
00:48 < shekib82> I don't understand the big words
00:48 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: and me, too, I am aware that this is not a quick discussion and one that it is easy to feel having had one time too many
00:48 < sj0rz> do you believe that there is no truth out there that is better than any arbitrary subjective view that one could conjure up?
00:48 < shekib82> some people believe the world is a simulation
00:49 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: I would say that one of the characteristics of that truth  out there is that it cannot be known as a whole
00:49 < sj0rz> yeah, maybe i should ask beforehand if people believe that some things are more true than others
00:49 < sj0rz> because if they aren't what is the point in discussions
00:50 < sj0rz> aloo_shu , okay but that seems like a separate argument to me
00:50 < shekib82> i suppose a person's ultimate truth is what's inside her mind
00:50 < sj0rz> so there is a truth that is more valuable than any arbitrary view?
00:50 < shekib82> i suppose so
00:50 < sj0rz> whether it can be known fully or not
00:50 < shekib82> the only thing that can be fully known is our own thoughts
00:51 < shekib82> everything else can be an illusion of our senses
00:51 < shekib82> so for example the circle is a more ultimate truth than the sun
00:51 < aggi> so moon does not exist when your not thinking about it?
00:51 < shekib82> it does to a degree, but it also can be your senses fooling you and it doesn't
00:52 < sj0rz> aloo_shu to me the knowledge that i cannot fully know the truth does not prompt me to stop trying to align my views with the truth
00:52 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: for me, it relates, I tend to call the best we have what you call arbitrary, it is not fully arbitrary, since we are communicating beings with a motivation to integrate truth both on an individual and a social level
00:52 < sj0rz> oh no i meant actually arbitraty
00:52 < sj0rz> i meant to ask
00:53 < sj0rz> i hope we can agree that not every arbitrary view that you could come up with is equally true as any other?
00:53 < aloo_shu> I could agree that much
00:53 < sj0rz> okay then from there i think we can have a meaningful discussion about any topic
00:53 < sj0rz> that is all that is needed
00:53 < sj0rz> but without it there is no meaningful discussion
00:54 < aloo_shu> but to make this transpersonally accepted will require convention
00:54 < aloo_shu> you need some minimal common ground, like acceptance of logic
00:54 -!- tmg [~tmg@unaffiliated/tmg] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
00:55 < sj0rz> okay, so do you accept logic
00:55 < aloo_shu> both logic and the limitations thereof
00:55 < aggi> your limitations aloo_shu 
00:55 < aloo_shu> axiomata, paradoxa
00:56 < sj0rz> well then we'd have to discuss what our views are on the limitations of logic, using our previously established agreement that some things are more true then others, and that logic is a thing
00:56 < aggi> 2+2=4
00:56 < sj0rz> i don't see why any of this is necessary for ordinary discussions about things like marxism though
00:56 < aloo_shu> yes, sj0rz but not tonight
00:56 < sj0rz> agreed
00:58 < aloo_shu> sj0rz: common ground is the keyword, you need some of it for a convo, but it is not always there, and a different set of handshake aplies if you want to set up common ground where previously there was none

00:58 < sj0rz> i generally assume that there is common ground in those areas
00:59 < sj0rz> (logic exists, some things are truer than others)

01:00 < shekib82> yes logic exists
01:01 < sj0rz> aggi haha
01:03 -!- oleo [~oleo@unaffiliated/oleo] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
01:03 < aggi> what about Karl Popper sj0rz ?
01:03 < sj0rz> i'm not familiar with his work
01:04 < Jana-Mana> A good one.
01:06 < aggi> the philosophical idea of Karl Popper fit onto a tiny sheet of paper
01:06 < shekib82> and what is it?
01:07 < Jana-Mana> about science
01:07 < shekib82> falsifiability?
01:07 < shekib82> it is a good argument for reality as we see it
01:09 < aggi> it provides some argument for what science is, and what is not
01:09 < aggi> neither of you didn't even state a thesis worth discussing so far
01:10 < aggi> leave alone did you supply any relevant evidence for anything
01:10 < sj0rz> i agree
01:12 < shekib82> here's a theory: "every human being has intrinsic value and should be respected"
01:13 < aggi> which is valid as an ethical argument, but doesn't touch science
01:13 < shekib82> ok so?
01:13 < shekib82> ethics is philosophy too
01:14 < bosspotato> >Concerning the method of science, the term indicates his rejection of classical empiricism, and the classical observationalist-inductivist account of science that had grown out of it. Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that scientific theories are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications.
01:14 < aggi> then shekib82, provide some evidence for "every human being has intrinsic value and should be respected"
01:14 < bosspotato> tl;dr Popperian falsifiability concerns science and not ethics
01:15 < shekib82> kant has provided a good argument for that
01:15 < bosspotato> no sane person could say that every single proposition has to be falsifiable in order to be accepted
01:15 < bosspotato> because that very proposition can't be falsified
01:18  * aggi is still waiting for the argument and evidence

01:19 < aggi> but what if a statement such as "every human being has intrinsic value and should be respected" would be nothing but ressentiment driven fake morale held up by chauvinists?
01:20 < bosspotato> hold on
01:20 < aggi> hence, even Adolf Eichmann argued he would have acted according to Kants categorial imperative

01:37 < bosspotato> some scientists get a little triggered by Popper because they think that his work rejects the idea of degree of truth altogether
