00:00 -!- jrabe [irc@janikrabe.com] has quit []
00:00 < aloo_shu> branch of [..], like what project(s)?
00:04 < pug> aloo_shu: ultimately Private Internet Access has seemingly been the most pronounced presence, but they do a lot with different distro groups like Ubuntu, there's a strong Wikipedia presence, NetHack is one of the few bigger gaming groups still really active.
00:04 -!- mezod [~mezod@unaffiliated/mezod] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
00:04 < pug> and a bunch of others i know nothing about. :)
00:04 < aloo_shu> and sizable staff, I've not yet completely understood the line between or ovelap of volunteers and staff in current freenode terminology
00:05 < pug> Oh most of the *staff* are volunteers.
00:06 < pug> the senior staff who maintain most of the infrastructure number less than ten last I checked. I'm not especially well informed in this area though.
00:06 < aloo_shu> bot staff proper are about a dozen, not sizable, whereas volunteers, I'd have to guess
00:06 < pug> Yeah, there used to be a lot more. They've slimmed way down on active staffers over the last couple of years.
00:07 < pug> But quite a few of the former staff still lurk and whatnot.
00:07 < pug> Interestingly enough.
00:08 < aloo_shu> *that* is another chapter, for another day, maybe. I got the feeling, too, but lack the experience to know the names :)
00:09 < aloo_shu> another question I had queued:
00:10 < pug> I don't make a habit of calling people out or drudging up nicks since it seems rude and potentially offensive, but yeah... some of them are exceptionally well read philosophy fans.
00:10 < pug> some day we may hear from them again. :P
00:11 < aloo_shu> what would be the hardware needs expressed for dummies, in, say, ordinary IBM PC Pentium age to registered users?
00:11 < aloo_shu> users to the computer
00:13 < pug> Oh, that's a good question. I can hardly remember. I know the first network cluster were served on a series of home desktops in the mid-nineties...
00:13 < pug> and they weren't especially powerful machines.
00:13 -!- riggs [~frog_@c-73-14-80-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] has quit [Client Quit]
00:13 < aloo_shu> and irc is basically just text
00:13 < pug> Yeah, it wasn't super stable but IRC is a super basic protocol ultimately.
00:15 < aloo_shu> probably today we afford the luxury of more and more complex network control traffic, but I'd feel safe to assume never more than 5% of total is control traffic
00:16 < aloo_shu> avg, attack time could be very different
00:16 < aloo_shu> so forget *never*
00:17 < pug> Alright, I've got to jet. Time to wrap up evening stuff so i can unwind.
00:17 < pug> thanks for the chat. :)
00:17 < pug> take care.
00:17 < aloo_shu> thank you, of course. :)
00:21 < aloo_shu> errrh, anybody could do me the favor to copy and paste the last 35 mins to pastebin, for my personal family album? my current irc client is just too simple to c&p or log.
00:21 < aloo_shu> 40min by now
00:22 < aloo_shu> definitely not intended to quote from, just for my own reference
00:23 < aggi> i could upload the log file aloo_shu
00:24 < aloo_shu> thanks, the last 45mins is enough
00:25 -!- buki [~buki@wn-res-nat-129-97-125-1.dynamic.uwaterloo.ca] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
00:27 < aloo_shu> I mean, thanks, yes, aggi
