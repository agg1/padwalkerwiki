<p>Welcome to this blog site of mine! Some may wonder why this site
even exists since there are that many others out there. Most people
prefer presenting their entire being on facebook and publish all
sorts of things and thoughts on social media. At best it is
WikiPedia articles some write in the hope these are not falsified
or spilled with irrelevant dis-information. Well, I don’t do any of
it. Instead this site was born just recently. It shall give You an
impression of what I am doing, how I am doing it, and why I am
doing it. If anyone wanted to contact me easily just try good old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>, which contrary
to Skype and all the other shiny web things had been an Internet
standard protocol since the beginning decades ago. Usually I hang
around on various networks, but You may give <a href=
"http://www.foonetic.net/">havocnet</a> a try and /query aggi
there. <a href=
"https://kiwiirc.com/client/www.foonetic.net/#nihilism">WebChat</a>
is available to simplify this for novices. If there was need for
authenticated and encrypted conversation <a href=
"https://hexchat.github.io/">Hexchat</a> or <a href=
"http://www.mirc.com/get.html">mIRC</a> with FiSH plugin alongside
transport layer encryption with SSL and SASL authentication may
serve sufficiently well for that purpose.</p>
<p>Now the obligatory info: my name is Michael and I’m 35 years old
already, I was born in Saxony East Germany where I grew up and
studied also. My home town is Mockau (this is how it is spelled
correctly but not Moscow nor <span lang="de-DE">Москва</span>)
which is part of city of Leipzig. It is an ancient slavic word
describing a muddy place in the swamps. Mockau’s history and
archaeological findings date back to the stone ages. Right now I am
living in Germany/Franconia which officially is part of the free
state of Bavaria. Most of the time, which is about 16 hours a day,
I am reading and studying technically related documents on computer
science, sometimes it is readings on modern quantum physics, also I
am reading regular news while remaining skeptical about all of it.
And now there will be some publishing available around here for You
to find out about my projects and thoughts. Sadly I’ve got no time
to translate all this into German language so if there is any error
with my English then please excuse it since I’m no native speaker.
Neither would I stress my Russian language skills no more since
there had been no chance to practice for a decade now. At least I
could transcribe Cyrillic letters and hope for a little
understanding.</p>
<p>Other than that I have studied telecommunications and computer
science, did coding for a decade now with all sorts of languages
such as Java, Perl, a little C, markups, frameworks, relational
database systems and NoSQL big data stores and what else there is
in the modern days of IT industry. Now I chose a good old static
site generator written in Perl as CMS to maintain this site. It is
powered by <a href="https://ikiwiki.info/">IkiWiki</a> and it is
just amazing what can be done with it to serve static content,
structured with an archive. Last years of my professional career I
had been concerned mainly with the implementation of release
management and system integration according to software engineering
best practices for companies such as Volkswagen, Audi, German
Aerospace Center, Eutelsat Distributor, Hager Group, German
Telekom, T-Mobile Austria and some others like these. Lately and
finally I declined a job offer from IBM company. It’ll be difficult
to catch up with documentation so most of the things here have to
be kept brief. If there was demand to know more on a particular
subject then please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>Right now and the last weeks, after years of struggling with any
kind of alternative there was, I am working on <a href=
"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page">Gentoo Linux</a>
things, particularly a hardened livecd release to be used with
anonymization services, cryptography related patches, system
tracing and profiling and this neat little blog to share the
results of my doings and thoughts. And one more thing: creating
shiny web sites is not my business. So if You’re wondering why
there is no Facebook, Twitter, Google like-it-button available my
answer is simple: I do not like it at all so there won’t be any of
this and very likely never will. Instead <a href=
"https://github.com/agg1">Github</a> might be worth having a look
at for productive software related tasks. Even non-technical staff
may find it useful to backup and archive things in the “Cloud” with
rudimentary sanity left. Soon you’ll find my backup git repository
there. I’ve just not decided yet what can and will be published
when it comes to the things I am doing ;)</p>
