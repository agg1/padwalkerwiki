<body lang="en-US" text="#00000a" dir="ltr">
<p class="western">Welcome to this blog site of mine! Some may wonder
why this site even exists since there are that many others out there.
Most people prefer presenting their entire being on facebook and
publish all sorts of things and thoughts on social media. At best it
is WikiPedia articles some write in the hope these are not falsified
or spilled with irrelevant dis-information. Well, I don’t do any of
it. Instead this site was born just recently. It shall give You an
impression of what I am doing, how I am doing it, and why I am doing
it. If anyone wanted to contact me easily just try good old <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a></u></span></font>,
which contrary to Skype and all the other shiny web things had been
an Internet standard protocol since the beginning decades ago.
Usually I hang around on various networks, but You may give <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="http://www.foonetic.net/">havocnet</a></u></span></font>
a try and /query aggi there. <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/www.foonetic.net/#nihilism">WebChat</a></u></span></font>
is available to simplify this for novices. If there was need for
authenticated and encrypted conversation <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">Hexchat</a></u></span></font>
or <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="http://www.mirc.com/get.html">mIRC</a></u></span></font>
with FiSH plugin alongside transport layer encryption with SSL and
SASL authentication may serve sufficiently well for that purpose.</p>
<p class="western">Now the obligatory info: my name is Michael and
I’m 35 years old already, I was born in Saxony East Germany where I
grew up and studied also. My home town is Mockau (this is how it is
spelled correctly but not Moscow nor <span lang="de-DE">Москва</span>)
which is part of city of Leipzig. It is an ancient slavic word
describing a muddy place in the swamps. Mockau’s history and
archaeological findings date back to the stone ages. Right now I am
living in Germany/Franconia which officially is part of the free
state of Bavaria. Most of the time, which is about 16 hours a day, I
am reading and studying technically related documents on computer
science, sometimes it is readings on modern quantum physics, also I
am reading regular news while remaining skeptical about all of it.
And now there will be some publishing available around here for You
to find out about my projects and thoughts. Sadly I’ve got no time
to translate all this into German language so if there was any error
with my English then please excuse it since I’m no native speaker.
Neither would I stress my Russian language skills no more since there
had been no chance to practice for a decade now. At least I could
transcribe Cyrillic letters and hope for a little understanding.</p>
<p class="western">Other than that I have studied telecommunications
and computer science at the university of applied science of the
German Telekom in Leipzig, did coding for a decade now with all sorts
of languages such as Java, Perl, a little C, markups, frameworks,
relational database systems and NoSQL big data stores and what else
there is in the modern days of IT industry. Now I chose a good old
static site generator written in Perl as CMS to maintain this site.
It is powered by <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://ikiwiki.info/">IkiWiki</a></u></span></font>
and it is just amazing what can be done with it to serve static
content, structured with an archive. Last years of my professional
career I had been concerned mainly with the implementation of release
management and system integration according to software engineering
best practices for companies such as Volkswagen, Audi, German
Aerospace Center, Eutelsat Distributor, Hager Group, German Telekom,
T-Mobile Austria and some others like these. Lately and finally I
declined a job offer from IBM company. It’ll be difficult to catch
up with documentation so most of the things here have to be kept
brief. If there was demand to know more on a particular subject then
please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p class="western">Right now and the last weeks, after years of
struggling with any kind of alternative there was, I am working on
<font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page">Gentoo
Linux</a></u></span></font> things, particularly a hardened livecd
release to be used with anonymization services, cryptography related
patches, system tracing and profiling and this neat little blog to
share the results of my doings and thoughts. And one more thing:
creating shiny web sites is not my business. So if You’re wondering
why there is no Facebook, Twitter, Google like-it-button available my
answer is simple: I do not like it at all so there won’t be any of
this and very likely never will. Instead <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://github.com/agg1">Github</a></u></span></font>
might be worth having a look at for productive software related
tasks. Even non-technical staff may find it useful to backup and
archive things in the “Cloud” with rudimentary sanity left. Soon
you’ll find my backup git repository there. I’ve just not decided
yet what can and will be published when it comes to the things I am
doing ;)</p>
