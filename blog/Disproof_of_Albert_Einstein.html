<p>For decades, to be precise since early 20<sup>th</sup> century
with the rise of “modern physics” science, a big question arose due
to a “world’s genius” ideas. This has led to all sorts of
confusions in school books and hilarious theories about the nature
of the universe spread, such as “big bang universe” which is said
to have a beginning and is expanding.</p>
<p>While even a bright child’s mind may ask: “How could that be? If
the universe had a beginning what had there been before? How could
nothing go boom if there isn’t anything?”. Still, this had been
insufficient so far to just put aside such “theories”. Instead
scientists and engineers have to agree with contradictions and
dogmas. So there we go… we must clarify what the misconceptions
with Einsteins ideas about “special relativity” and “speed of
light” are.</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name=
"__RefHeading___Toc229_1057113203"></a>The Simple Truth – There is
NO Speed of Light at all</h1>
<p>Galileo Galileo, Rene Descartes, Aristoteles and many other
scientists and philosophers debated for centuries if either speed
of light may be zero, whether it is constant or infinite. Poincare
and Lorentz made significant contributions on the ground of the
assumption speed of light existed. But none of them ever asked:
<em>Does light, which is an electromagnetic wave, have a property
of speed at all? Does speed of light exist at all?</em> If there
was such a property called “speed of light”, then according to
scientific method, an experiment should be made to measure the
speed. There is no need to argue what concepts such as space and
time may be, a speed could be measured by simply, well it might not
be that simple after all, having two observers each with a precise
clock, one observer sending a signal at time x1, and the other
observer waiting for the signal to be received at time x2. And
while space travel is possible nowadays one observer could even be
sent to moon and wait for a strong signal sent from earth to
measure the delay of the signal if it was propagating with a speed.
If there is no delay between x1 and x2, or if the delay is below
margin of error, then no evidence was available for a property of
speed of light. And this is exactly the situation with “modern
physics science”. No evidence is available for either a property of
speed of light, the expansion of the universe, black holes, time
travel or all sorts of other assumptions around this “theory”. And
while no speed of light could be measured until today with
extremely precise measurement and sensory equipment, instead all
sorts of weird statements are made such as while speed of light is
said to be 300000 km/s it would be constant relative to a moving
observers anyway. So without jumping to conclusions before
referring to “real” applied science with electromagnetic waves
right now it should be obvious already there must be reasons why
<em>all books on physics science</em> are spreading lies when it
comes to “speed of light” stated to be 300000 km/s. Also, there is
other dis-information and confusion spread concerning speed of
light, it’s nature of particle-wave dualism, the nature of matter
with the equivalence of energy and mass, or the “doppler effect”
which is not appropriate to argue red-shift would provide evidence
for an expanding universe.</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name=
"__RefHeading___Toc231_1057113203"></a>The Properties of Light</h1>
<p>While there is no such thing as “speed of light”, and the
wording has to be precise since nothing can be faster then a thing
which does not exist, meaning “exceeding speed of light” would
translate to “being faster then nothing” which is nonsense.
Nonetheless electromagnet waves can be characterized with
properties which are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c2">
<p>Frequency</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Amplitude</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Phase</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Polarisation</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Angular Frequency (Omega=2Pi*f)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some derived properties of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c2">
<p>Energy</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Intensity</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>And many more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also there is various prominent observations with electromagnet
waves:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c2">
<p>Wave Interference</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Phase Shift</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Frequency Shift</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Resonance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these properties are relevant for applied science such as
radio carrier wave signal modulation, lasers, photography, solar
cells, radar guns, GPS satellite navigation and almost all other
today’s high tech which benefits from the findings of “quantum
physics”. Contrary there is not a single practical application
related to the “special relativity theory” and the assumption of a
property of “speed of light” which it relies upon. In fact, every
single equation which refers to a property of speed of light ‘c’
could either be considered irrelevant or being crude fake science
leading to discussions around time travel and similar weird
phantasies.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name=
"__RefHeading___Toc233_1057113203"></a>How does GPS Localization
Radar and Radar Speed Guns Work then if Speed of Light Cannot be
Measured?</h1>
<p>Imagine a “standing wave”, since there is no propagation speed
of light, being transmitted by the radar gun or GPS satellite:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c2">
<p>The electromagnet wave is transmitted</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>The electromagnetic wave instantaneously (since there is no
propagation speed of light) hits a (probably moving) target such as
a car or aircraft and the wave again is instantaneously being
reflected</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>The wave and it’s reflection INTERFERE, also instantaniously</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>This interference pattern (signal strength) is measured</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;insert illustration&gt;</p>
<p>All this happens without a propagation speed of electromagnetic
waves being involved.</p>
<p>To measure speed with a radar gun if a target is moving:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c2">
<p>The phase of the reflected wave shifts according to target’s
position</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>And the resulting signal measured due to wave interference
pattern changes (pulsing)</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>And the interference pulsing speed indicates the speed of the
moving target</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>Which, again, is not related to a non-existent property of speed
of light</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To estimate the location of a target with GPS satellite
signals:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c2">
<p>Again interference pattern of a wave and its reflection is
measured</p>
</li>
<li class="c2">
<p>But with multiple wave interference patterns from three or more
moving GPS satellites have to be measured</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;insert illustration&gt;</p>
<p>Of cause all this is not trivial and according to the desired
use case the properties of the electromagnetic radar waves such as
wave length and amplitude must be tuned to allow for reasonable
measurements at all. Also note, it is not “doppler effect” (meaning
a frequency shift according to target speed) which books on physics
and Wikipedia articles are spreading dis-information about which is
involved with it… it is the phase shift and its change with
interfering waves relative to the position of a radar target and
observer.</p>

up the Light and How Fast Information can be Transmitted</h1>
<p>Common saying is nothing can be transmitted or move faster then
speed of light. This might be considered true since there is no
thing which could move faster than something which does not exist.
Got it? If there is no propagation speed than movement relative to
it is pointless, as is the statement speed of light would be
constantly measured as 300000 km/s regardless of relative movement
to light source. Also there is no frequency shift involved with
relative movements to a light source but phase shift alone. But
let’s get to the point, what are the restrictions then to transmit
information with electromagnetic waves? In essence it all comes
down to the fact that it is impossible to “switch” a signal in
absolute zero time, meaning all signal changes need some time. That
it takes time for a signal to change state, to switch, is not at
all related to an erroneously stated propagation speed of the
information this signal change carries. Here is a short list of
related mathematical theories which are applied in practice for
mobile phone radio signal modulation for example:</p>
<div class="c3">
<p>Perfect Dirac impulse and occupied frequency band of it: an
instant zero-time impulse would occupy infinite bandwidth</p>
</div>
<p>&lt;insert formulas&gt;</p>
<div class="c3">
<p>Fourier analysis of a perfect rectangular signal would occupy
infinite bandwidth</p>
</div>
<p>&lt;insert formulas&gt;</p>
<p>Bottom line: shining up a light always takes time. The faster a
signal carrying information changes, the more bandwidth it
occupies. Infinite “fast” transmission of information would occupy
all available frequencies from zero to infinite. Good luck when
applying for a license to acquire this frequency band from your
regulator.</p>
